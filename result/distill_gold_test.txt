you know , one of the great things in travel and one of the pleasure of the research research is to live with people who remember the old days . the past is still losing the muscle , they &apos;re going to taste the muscle .
just the idea that the world is still walking beyond the milky milky way or the importance of the myths of the inuit , or that the himalayas is still the buddhist of the most important , and that &apos;s the idea of the reality that we &apos;re living in , and it &apos;s the idea that the world is , in the world , is the idea of the world that we live in , and it &apos;s the idea of the reality that we &apos;re living in , and it &apos;s the idea of the reality that we
and of course , we all share the same thing .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re going to bring kids to the world .
we &apos;re walking through .
we have to engage with the 17th separation of the death of death , and so it should not surprise us that we all sing , dancing and art .
but interesting is the unique tone of the brain , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it &apos;s not a role , whether it &apos;s about the the forest in the woods , or the most , in haiti , or the warrior in haiti , or the warrior in the world &apos;s in the world , or a half , and it &apos;s happened to the desert .
all these people teach us that it &apos;s another other thing , other ways , other ways to have other ways to have the celebrity on earth .
and that &apos;s a notion that if you think about it , one with hope can be able to meet .
together , the vast cultures of the world are a net from the world , and cultural lives , which is the earth and for the most important thing that the earth is as important as the biological , which you know as biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural system as a kind of a more , a lot of the time , and it can be the most important thing to do , and dreams , myths , symbols , and the characteristic of the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness , defined .
the most great legacy is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we &apos;re doing as amazing species .
and as the biosphere was very fed , this was happening with the most larger speed -- only greater speed .
no biologist would be a biologist to say that 50 percent or more of all kinds of things are the extinction , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet , this -- the most , the most , the thing that we &apos;re known with as a result of the cultural diversity .
and the key astronomer for this is extinction .
when everybody was born in this room , they were talking about 6,000 languages .
now , a language isn &apos;t just the complete of the vocabulary or a series of the world &apos;s .
a language is expression of human mind .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a particular culture is access to the material world .
every language is like a kind of a forest of the mind , a turning thought , a thought , a kind of a purpose .
and from these 6,000 languages today , while we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , just half the people are not in the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught to be taught by the way that they &apos;re not going to be done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely when the silence is to be a very of the last person who &apos;s talking to your language , no way to give the wisdom of the ancestors , or the hope of the other kids ?
and yet , this horrible fate actually has someone on earth , about all two weeks , because all two weeks , die , one older person , and take the last centimeter of a old language with the grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; is it not better ? &quot; would the world not be a better place if we &apos;re all talking about a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be a little bit of the language . &quot;
let &apos;s be powerless . &quot;
and then you would recognize how it would be , if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so , i want to take you in a journey today through the most , a short journey through the most , a short journey through the most , to try to understand what &apos;s actually lost .
now there are some of us who forget that i &apos;m going to say , if i say , &quot; different possibilities of his being , &quot; really different possibilities of his .
so , for example , take this kid of the arctic in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the world &apos;s brain , believe that they &apos;re going to be the most important the world &apos;s most , in the belly of sacred snakes .
this is a people who are not cognitively between colors blue and green , because the forest is dependent on the forest , from the people who are dependent on the people , the people who are dependent on the people .
they have a more powerful language , and a more of the linguistic , the linguistic of the linguistic , is you have to marry somebody who &apos;s talking to another language .
all of this is the most profound past in the world &apos;s most profound house , which is the most powerful house in which the most of the time of the six or seven languages are talking about that , but that you &apos;re never listening to somebody who &apos;s learning language .
they just hear to speak and start talking .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes i ever lived with , the most amazing in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people who were first in 1969 .
in 1957 , five millimeters tried to take contact and made a mistake mistake .
they were going to be the ones out of the air , which we would say as a friendly gesture . they forgot that these people were never seen from the rainforest in their lives .
they took these photographs from the forest forest , trying to see behind the face or the character , nothing and the character , that this is the business business of the devil and killing the five of the gifts with the spear .
but the most , they didn &apos;t just kill the spear .
they &apos;re going to be more .
jill percent of deaths happened by the deaths .
we were going to get the most of the time back and found two cases of a natural death and as we were doing people with a fool of the people , they gave them that one of the people died as old as he died and we were killing him with the spear .
but at the same time they had a clear knowledge of the forest , which was amazing .
their hunters could smell the urine of a animal from 40 steps , and determine what animals of this was .
and in the early world , i got a really amazing task when my professor asked me to go to the harvard , if i was interested in haiti , to go to haiti and the secret societies that were used to make the foundation of the strength .
and to give a sense of this big sense , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of the most remarkable belief of the world &apos;s knowledge and a billionaire of the black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex pipe .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask you , the great world &apos;s big world would be done , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , or whatever .
a continent is going to go , because the guess was that it doesn &apos;t give a religious belief in sub-saharan africa , of course , and of course , there was a little bit of the black religious thoughts that &apos;s the tragic of the most profound .
but what &apos;s interesting about this is that this living relationship is the relationship between the living and the dead .
the living rate of the spirit .
the spirit can be made from the big water , answers to the rhythm of dance to central the soul of the living director , so that the most little for a short bright moment is going to be the god .
and the most , the most , the most , &quot; you want to go to church , &quot; you &apos;re talking about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the mind , you &apos;ll get out of the mind . how can you make damage ?
look at this amazing demonstrations : the most , in a computer , the red coal without burning the water of the mind , a amazing graph of the mind that this is the body , if it &apos;s going to be in a state of extreme arousal .
well , from all people i met , the hejaz was from sierra nevada in the sierra nevada of santa nevada in the most extraordinary .
offspring of the old of the old civilization civilization , the heart of colombia , and in the end of the board , this people moved into a very a profound basis of the world , which is about the u.n. of the world &apos;s , which is the most remote thing .
in a sense of a continent , these people were the only ones that were never approved by the most of the time .
until today , you &apos;re going to be a ritual priesthood , but the education is very extraordinary .
the young , the young of three and four years of their families separated and in a world &apos;s world , in the front of the water , in the front of the glacier for 18 years , and two time of pregnancy , they spent the great mother in the lap of the great mother .
and as this whole time , they &apos;re confronted in the values of their society . values that include the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say that ecological -- balance .
at the end of this amazing , you &apos;ll suddenly get out of one day , and the first time in her life , in the age of 18 years , you see a collector , and in this kind of case of consciousness , it &apos;s going to be a lot of what you &apos;ve been doing in abstract decision-making .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition will be very important .
whenever we think about textbooks and landscape , we either think of it , and the old piece of the buddhist wild , which is in his being a sense of the idea , or the other people are more connected to nature than we .
so , textbooks are neither more unhealthy , they will be more of the suburbs .
it &apos;s not a lot of space for this in the world &apos;s exclusive standpoint , or the cold winds of tibet , but they still have a significant , and ritual , and the one of the things that are shaped is , you know , it &apos;s not going to be the way that the earth is going to be .
now , what does this mean ?
it means that a little child from the yemeni , which is in faith that the mountain is a more , a half , which is a very different person , and you can determine a different relationship , and a different relationship , and a different child , and the way a little kid is going to be made of montana .
if he &apos;s a built-in one of a mind or a bunch of plastic , it &apos;s irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defined the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the woods of british colombia , and i believed that these forests are there , to become a , to become a .
and that made me a different person as my friends under the most remote , who believe that these forests of the reverse of the reverse and the curved minds are , the most remote thing that they would be involved in in their own own .
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries .
it &apos;s a photograph that i took last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is a lot of you heard about the many of you , the most powerful of the repertoire of the singularity .
what &apos;s so fascinating is not just the most important potential of this kind of thing , but it &apos;s actually made of two different sources of the brain , and it &apos;s made of the wooden , and there &apos;s a little bit of these wooden things that are going to be like , but it &apos;s a little bit like this .
this plant contains some very strong amounts of energy that serotonin , and the most similar thing is very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the most little , you &apos;ve seen this stuff , this substance , that they &apos;re making out of different kinds of things .
this powder is about being taken from a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a , and the landing of the water of electricity , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to make a bias of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have a professor , richard evan , who &apos;s the man who &apos;s the most important , the most magical mushrooms in mexico in mexico , and i said that you can &apos;t be able to get this kind of thing to do .
but the thing with the most remote thing is that they can &apos;t be taken to the , because they &apos;re in the human gut of course , and they &apos;re going to be called the enzyme .
you can only be able to be able to be able to get a few other chemicals that the mao &apos;s .
now the fascinating thing is that the most intriguing , which contain in the world &apos;s most , are the kind of thing that is necessary to be the most difficult to be able to do .
how can these people get from a battlefield from 80,000 species of plants that are not related to these two of these two types of plants that are combined when they combine this way , a kind of a kind of a little bit of the parts of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trying and error , which turns out as an meaningless .
but you ask the indians , you say , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the most remote , have 17 varieties of the world who you all see in big distance in the forest that &apos;s going to be a kind of way .
and then you ask them how they &apos;re expanding their own own and they say , &quot; i thought something about plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you take every one of the 17 varieties of the day , and they sing to a different kind of a different kind of thing .
well , that doesn &apos;t bring you a ph.d. in harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting .
now , the problem is that even those are the ones under us , the sympathy for the difficult situation , they &apos;re like a more , but they &apos;re looking at the past , but the real world , which is our world , is the world , competing .
so , the fact is that you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century , in 300 years , or technical innovations , but it &apos;s actually as a era where we were tracking and the massive destruction of biological and cultural methods . so the problem is not the change .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new health systems .
and the problem is not the technology .
the most , the most little to be heard of sioux , as they bow and arrow , as the americans stopped to be americans , when they were the horse and the most of the tasks .
not change and technology is the integrity of the most of the time . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of the rule .
and wherever you &apos;re in the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures are not the opposite of the opposite . these are dynamic living peoples whose existence is going to be in the way that they &apos;re going to be able to be able to get the forest in the forest , and they &apos;re going to be able to get to the north of the sea , and they &apos;re going to be able to get a lot of the time in the forest .
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m going to go much working in a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the genocide , the most devastating extinction of people is being convicted of people , but the most , the destruction of the lifestyle of people , will not just be convicted of the human , but generally , and in general , as part of a computer .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the educational of the world , if you haven &apos;t seen it on the level of the level .
i was going to go to a young colleagues , 6,000 miles of the point of the view of the world &apos;s own in the world &apos;s own , and i was just looking for the bureaucratic , and i was looking for the face of the statistics that you hear . 6,000 million people who were murdered in the corporate and immoral . 1.2 million people who were murdered . 1.2 million people who were murdered .
the father of this young man was identified as a tag of the brain lama .
that meant that he was immediately killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle was going to be in the diaspora who brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked up when punishment was to be wealthy for the crime .
he was stuck in the age of two years in prison to hide under her own favorite , because she couldn &apos;t live .
the sister who did this bold , was brought up in a computer system .
one day she came out of a slave , and for these of the most , they had to be a heavy camp of camp .
the suffering of the educational of the world can be more , but the most of the minds of people is something more than a little bit of the people .
and at the end , we really have a choice of choice , and we want to live in a world &apos;s world , or in a world &apos;s world ?
margaret , and the great anthropologist said before she died , that it &apos;s their greatest fear that while we &apos;re in direction of a thread , we &apos;re not just going to be able to see the whole range of human imagination , but we &apos;ve forgotten that we &apos;ve ever got a dream of a dream of the human imagination , but we &apos;ve forgotten that we &apos;ve ever got a dream of a dream .
and it &apos;s a mixed to think that our species may have been there for 600,000 years .
the most , the revolution that brought us to agriculture , and we &apos;re in this moment of the emergence of the world &apos;s favorite system , the poetry of the the the the priesthood , and hierarchy , specialization and surplus -- found a lot of 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , these sticky story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we &apos;re in the next millennia .
if we ask these giant amounts of vision to the importance of human questions , you know with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we will be able to be the possibility that we are : people with full consciousness , which is aware of the importance that all people and gardens are going to be able to flourish .
here &apos;s a photograph i took on the northern end of the northern end , when i went to the most remote , and this man , the one , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit and during the most years in the process of our rule , they were forced to pull in settlements .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather refused .
the family , the fear of his life had all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit don &apos;t have fear of the cold . they used them to their advantage .
the most of your own the rest of the rest were originally made of fish , which was made in the world &apos;s own .
the photographer of man didn &apos;t fear the arctic night or the scanner .
he &apos;s going out , he took his pants off , and he was going down to his hand , and when the waste of the waste began to get it into the form of a a graph .
he &apos;s going to go to the pages of the world &apos;s pages and it was completely frozen , he was a dog with it .
he &apos;s the dog , and he was a a a a a a new , and it took the skeleton of the dog and damaged a way to put a different dog on the front of the morning , and the most remote dog on the front of the table .
so you can &apos;t do anything .
and this is a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all the native people on the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april 1999 , the complete control of a field , which is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country and called the so-called .
it &apos;s an independent area . it &apos;s all the most remote .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state , the most , the most , with his people , can get to the people .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are traveled to these distant goals of the earth , to recognize that they &apos;re not away .
they &apos;re the most of the time .
they represent parts of human imagination , which is in past times , and for all of us , dreams will be the dreams of the children , like the dreams of our own life .
what we &apos;re trying to do in national geographic is that we believe politicians never do something .
we believe that the most important -- we believe that the most compelling is not compelling , but we believe storytelling can change the world and we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling . our website gets 35 million of the month .
so , more potent nations send our main system .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we can take a series of travel in the world &apos;s most , which we &apos;re taking our audience to places that they &apos;re going to take from the world to the places that they &apos;re going to be able to do , and hopefully , they &apos;re going to take a lot of the central revelation in the preparation that we can do in a really delicate endeavor .
thank you .
what i first do first , so fast as possible , is going to show the basic work , a new technology that we have microsoft as part of a year ago , and it &apos;s a environment that you can either do . it &apos;s a environment that you can either do . it &apos;s a environment where you can either get local or it &apos;s a environment where you can either get locally or it &apos;s a environment that you either can do with a huge amount of visual data .
we see many , many books on digital photos here , which you &apos;re going to see and it &apos;s constantly a lot of the way that you can see , in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this is a scan of the war of the war , and it &apos;s in a domain of 300 .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that the performance of a system can be like this , the number of pixels on your screen , and it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of the world &apos;s .
this is a house house of dickens . every column is an chapter .
to prove that it really is about a text and not about a picture , we can do something like that , to actually show that this one is a real representation of the brain and no image .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a more of a sudden .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a case of a case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a documentary .
and that &apos;s really what the pleasure and the good experience is a real kind of a magazine or a newspaper , or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with several scales .
we also made something on the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a false display with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we added extra content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical lamarr .
and this is really what this is going to happen to these ideas , these limitations for the available place on the screen .
we hope that it doesn &apos;t mean that , and others is more , that should not be necessary .
of course , the mapping is the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i &apos;m really not going to spend a lot of time , except saying that we &apos;re going to be able to do this area .
but these are all roads in the united states .
the top of the top of nasa &apos;s image of nasa .
let &apos;s get something else out .
this is even live in the internet . you can get it .
this is a project with the name of the name , which is really two different technologies together .
one is a very good research , and the other is a very good research about the most good research that &apos;s from noah , a college student of washington , under steve , under steve .
and rick &apos;s research was done by microsoft research . a very good collaboration .
so this is live in the internet . it &apos;s driven by the most of the time .
you can see that if we create this kind of views , which we can penetrate through images and make this experience of the mexican resolution .
but the spatial structure of the images is actually in the importance of meaning .
the most , and the most , these images have been able to have been able to have this real space , which is where these images are all near the most near in the canadian , and they &apos;re seeing elements of the other .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ve got time to show you other environments .
there are which , which is a lot of non-zero-sum .
i &apos;d like to show you a little bit of the original data data of noah and that &apos;s from a early prototype of the world we &apos;ve been working on in summer to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology . and this is not necessarily as obvious as you see the environments that we have .
we had to worry about the lawyers , and we &apos;re worried about the lawyers .
this is a circular panel of the cathedral , the lady that &apos;s just in the computer with images of flickr . give them a just lady in flickr , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in the t-shirts , and every one of these orange millennium is discovered . every one of these orange dishes is discovered .
so this is all the most common , and they all stand in space in the way .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i &apos;m going to work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the communist here .
and i guess you can see that this is many different kinds of cameras : everything is to professional research , a pretty large number of them , which are all in this environment .
and if you can , i &apos;ll find some of the weird weird .
many of you are documented by faces , etc .
somewhere here is a series of photographs here -- here they are .
this is actually a poster of the squid , which was recorded right .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point is that we can do things with social environment , and it &apos;s now collected data from all -- from the entire collective memory of how , visual the earth looks like , and everything is connected to each other .
all these photos are connected to each other and it &apos;s going to be something bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from all the earth .
look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen earth &apos;s virtual earth .
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s using the complexity , with people using it , growing and use the user for the user .
their own photos are going to be a lot of the time that has a different person .
if someone has done the hard , and all of these holy , and they were offering , who they &apos;re all , then my photo is going to be able to make the whole thing , and i can use it as a start to use the other of the other people , and so they &apos;re using a kind of a kind of a kind of a little bit of a social experience .
and of course , byproduct of all of that are the enormous rich models of each interesting part of each of the earth that &apos;s not just by the most interesting part of the earth , and that &apos;s how they have been able to get through collective memory .
thank you .
so , i understand it right ? your software allows you to be a certain time within the next few years , all the images that are used by someone in the world in the world ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t make anything else .
if you want to make it , they &apos;re going to be able to attract them between the images .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the amount of information information that many of these images have .
as if you do a kind of a computer for images , where they put sentences and the text of the website , many information that is the picture .
but how would it be , if the picture you connected with all your images ?
then the amount of the processing of the processing of the processing and the amount of the money that makes it really enormous . it &apos;s a classic .
namaste , that &apos;s really incredible . thank you .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , like i hope , in the way , in the other things you &apos;ve heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections , if you &apos;re not noticed that .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official &quot; .
the official of what ?
the official of all western societies of all western societies .
the official of the official works is : if our goal is the most common of our citizens , it &apos;s all about the most remote of freedom of freedom .
the reason that freedom is in itself is good , valuable , sense , a sense of the human premise for human .
if people have freedom , everybody &apos;s about to do things that we have to maximize our own lives and nobody has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom , they have the more freedom , and the more freedom they have , the more good .
this is , i think , so deep in our water water chain that it would not be in the sense of the point .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what allows us modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say something about a little bit about a little bit of a time .
there &apos;s a nonprofit in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t get the 10 different extra extra extra , and 12 of them could buy them to make a big number of their own on the store , which is not the beginning of the shop for them .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the business business to put a stereo -- speaker , a , a , radio , a radio , radio , and in this one of the electronics , there are so many requests .
we can put a million different entities in the components that are offered in this one business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , and you could have a telephone , you could have a telephone that you wanted to be , as long as he came from the senior bell .
they deceive their phone . they don &apos;t bought it .
one consequence of that was that the phone never broken .
these days are over .
we have almost a infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- the most , more , a lot of the time , and the most devastating , and the most devastating .
and you should not have seen that in your business now , you can be sure that they &apos;re going to be .
and what it does is it &apos;s bringing people to run into business and ask this question .
now , you know what the answer is to be on this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life , that &apos;s very important than buying the objects , the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s not longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could make a make or we could make b .
a has this benefits and risks .
b has this benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a few , a has this benefits and the risks and b , and the risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
the result is to make it -- we call it &quot; patients autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift of the burden of the responsibility of the choices of someone knows about the following -- the patient &apos;s face .
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for the prescription drugs for people like they and me , if you think about it , no sense , because we don &apos;t buy it .
why do you take around us when we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , you expect to call the doctor the next morning and ask a change of the prescription .
so something so profound as our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide .
we don &apos;t have identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re so often doing that as often as we want .
that means that every day , if you wake up at the morning , you need to decide what to be a kind of person you want .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where the most , in fact , had a had one and that she had so fast as they could , and then they got so fast children as they could .
the only real choice was , who , not when , and not what they did .
today , everything is just to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and that doesn &apos;t because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry , or not ? should i marry ?
should i marry later ? should i have kids , or just do a career ? &quot;
these are all the most powerful questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions of whether that means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m going to give you and not good grade in my class .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , like carl shows , with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every day from every day -- until the most on the hotel .
there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you about , which is the most important thing that i &apos;m going to do .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of work , again , and again , and again , if we should work or not work .
we can look at our children at football , and we have our mobile phone on a hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and also , if you &apos;re all off , every minute we &apos;re going to ask our child to be a nuclear question of the brain &apos;s disease , we also should ask that call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; is it certainly your experience of the child &apos;s experience , very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and little things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world we lived in the world was that .
so , i want to say , there was some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world we &apos;re seeing now is that .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to be about what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , the way that he &apos;s going to be able to get to free .
so , with so many options you can choose , it falls very hard to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another one of the most more of the examples of this , a study about investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to the most remote of the world &apos;s giant , the giant of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 of the most remote ones who were offered the employer , took the participation to two percent .
they provide 50 of them -- 10 percent less employees , when they &apos;re just going to offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 , the choice of the choice is so hard to decide what you &apos;re going to choose to do on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , it never &apos;s coming .
understand that it &apos;s not just called the people eating food when they go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go to the launch , it means that they &apos;re going to make a great amount of water .
and they &apos;re not giving participation to 5,000 u.s. dollars per year on the world &apos;s worth of the day , which would have been happy to reproduce .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
and i think it &apos;s going to be that the world looks like this .
you want to really make the decision really , if it &apos;s all the popcorn , right ?
they don &apos;t want to pick up the wrong investment , or they &apos;re going to be able to get the wrong kind of thing .
so this is a effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end up with less to the outcome of choice than we had to decide between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is , by the big risk of different choices , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is a perfect thing , and it &apos;s just a little bit of the time that it was going to be a little bit more .
the more possibilities there are , the easier is not to regret that , it &apos;s disappointing the choice that they &apos;re doing .
second , what economists call the so-called .
dan gilbert has made a big point of time by telling how much the way we care about it is what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to think about it , it &apos;s just attractive properties of alternatives that they &apos;re going to get to be able to do with the alternatives that they chose .
here &apos;s an example . for the one of you who are not new york , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a few on the drums .
very expensive .
beautiful beach . great day . they have everything for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; man thinks &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my own neighborhood is gone .
i could park directly from my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks of the thought that he missed the possibility , day , a great parking parking .
and the happiness is the happiness that we get through our choice , even if that &apos;s what we chose .
and the more possibilities that are the choice of the choice , the more attractive properties of this choice in the world &apos;s .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon makes some statements .
he &apos;s going to make a statement about it now and maybe things slow to do things .
but a more important point he &apos;s doing is : always who you decide for one thing , you don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things like many attractive properties , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do less powerful .
third : the expectations of expectations .
this has met me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost the whole time .
and there was a time in the course of it , and they had bought them , and they bought them , and they were bad , they were incredibly , incredibly , very much enough and often enough , they started to be .
so to buy new jeans after many years of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple of jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the senior man said , &quot; do you want to make sure , easy , or big ?
do you want buttons or a half ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you want to cut down far away , the blah blah blah , blah , and so on , he told .
my jaw was down and after i recovered , i &apos;d like to have the way that i &apos;d like to do the only way that was the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour of all these damn jeans , and i &apos;m going to go down the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best right jeans i ever had .
i had better . all of these choices allowed me to have better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it myself .
the reason that i felt bad was that i felt bad with all these possibilities , my expectations for what &apos;s a good pair of jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations when it was just in a kind of way .
when they came in 100 ways , damn , a little bit of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i had to get to what i expected , and what i had was stuck in comparison to what i expected .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to add in the lives of people in life of people , which are actually increasing the expectations of the people who are going to be the way that they &apos;re going to be good .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this . because if you would , you know , you don &apos;t know what it is here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is , it was all better than anything was worse than anything was worse , it was possible to make the people possible to do a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world we live -- we &apos;re wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best for you can be the things that you can do .
they &apos;re never going to be pleasant because their expectations , my expectations , are big .
the secret to the most , that &apos;s what they all come -- the secret to the most remote expectations are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i didn &apos;t have better . i didn &apos;t have a lot of myself .
but it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of the most bad sitting sitting in front of a bad sitting , when it &apos;s just a kind of way to buy that if you &apos;re a little bit of a way , and you ask , who is responsible , the world is responsible .
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy a teapot , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is , you know , it &apos;s .
they could have better do it .
and in a hundred different ways of jeans in the gang , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , if people make decisions , and even if the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think that , i think , is not the only , but a significant thing to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have been experiencing the fearless because they have to explain that experience . and then if they have to explain these experiences .
and so this is the most important thing that it &apos;s generally going to be better , objective , and we feel bad .
so let me remind you .
this is the official of the official , which we all hold for right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that is better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choice than something .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we missed this point for a long time to improve our public .
now , as a rule , i &apos;m almost finished -- as a rule of question , which is about thinking about the thinking of that . what &apos;s all these choices allow us to do in the industrialized societies , the material is wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we heard from many of them , not to be the big choice .
your problem is that you have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s frustrating and angry is , steve mcdonough has told you about how these expensive and hard car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
they even hurt .
it &apos;s a bad thing that we &apos;re doing .
if something that makes people make our society , to make the societies in the societies , they would have shifted to a little bit of choice , wouldn &apos;t only be improved in the lives of people , but our dignity also will be improved .
economists call this a kind of a application of application .
and it &apos;s going to be concerned for all of it , and it &apos;s not just the poor -- because all these big choices are going to be a little bit of us .
finally , read this cartoon , and , you know , a advanced person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know it in this kind of thing . &quot;
agent imagination , a computer view of the world -- and that is the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about this , the more i came to view that the fish knows something .
because the truth is that if you break the most , that &apos;s what it &apos;s possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the most , that everything is possible , they &apos;re going to reduce happiness .
they increase the paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a more of the time .
this is almost a perfect security -- maybe for the fish , definitely for us .
but the most important thing is , the most important thing is a recipe for misery , and i suspect disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects before , over the human genome and what could mean , and what could mean about the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve been facing biology and now we try to get from digital code to a new phase of biology by making new life and build .
we always tried to ask a significant question .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists tried to understand and that on different levels .
we tried to simplify different approaches to simplify it to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve been in almost 20 years , and when we sequenced the most , the change of the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
now , let &apos;s try to ask if we can regenerate life or if we can create new lives , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , flop , which has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we tried to get it to a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it on about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that &apos;s here .
but if we look at these fragments , that &apos;s very simple , in comparison to our own , trust me , that &apos;s simple , but if we all look at these genes we can take a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to actually put this chromosome on the front of this chromosome , which allows us to vary the individual components and so some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we put a chromosome ?
does it allow the chemistry to make this really big molecules before that never been done before ?
and , if we can , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of chemical materials .
our steps in the world &apos;s life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code is very slowly designed but yet , and our last point would be on a exponential curve .
we started 15 years ago .
it actually took some years to a 401 review before we did the first experiments .
and it turns out , as a result , it turns out .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world , and they can make the little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters , but it &apos;s a little bit of a process , the longer , more mistakes .
so we had to develop a new method with that little pieces we could put together and correct the mistakes .
that was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x .
it &apos;s a little virus of bacteria killing .
we made small pieces , made a theoretical and a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of chemical chemical and gave them a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then released by the cells and came back and killed e. .
i &apos;ve talked about the oil industry recently , and they said they were doing this model right now .
they laughed more than her .
so we think that this is actually a situation in the software , actually , building their hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go to a lot of further . we wanted to build a whole whole chromosome , and it &apos;s got more than a more than a word of the novel letters . so we thought we could build it in a hurry of the virus of the virus .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information really has to be completely accurate .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the most important one was a mistake in a 10,000 base base .
we found the most mistakes in the world &apos;s 30 mistakes , if we had used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to make pieces that are 50 letters for the 50 letters , and that &apos;s what we need to do with other people &apos;s pieces to build smaller more than that .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built the way we &apos;ve built it .
think about it : we have a code of code : a , c , g and t. t. and t. t. t. and t. t. t. .
and the letter of this letter -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we just signed up .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we &apos;ve designed the pieces that we could just break them with enzymes , and there are enzymes that repair these and again .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces of pieces , and they put these together to make these together to make these together , to make these together , until to get to the other .
in every step , we &apos;ve produced these pieces in the surplus , we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process , what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we tried to get the point of the most of the time .
so , this looks like a kind of a kind of a .
if we get to this right bits -- with 100,000 base centers -- then these aren &apos;t just going to be fed in e. . it &apos;s all the possibilities of modern molecular molecular biology , and so we used other mechanisms .
we knew from a mechanism of the world &apos;s population , which is used to repair biology , which can bring dna together to bring dna together .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s a organism called the three million wheel of the three million wheel .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything has been combined as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely dried , they can even live in the vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life in space , and it can move to the search of the conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a kind of a molecule that we &apos;ve made by using this processes -- actually , we &apos;ve just used the real design with the right design of the pieces we have . yeast add these then together .
this is not a regular thing that is a regular amount of time .
it &apos;s a big molecule that we can even see with the most remote .
these are footage about a duration of six seconds .
this is the characteristic that we &apos;ve been doing recently .
these are over the computer &apos;s code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with the whole molecule that has ever been created by people .
it has a kind of a lot of millions of millions .
if we would print it with a 10 and no distances , it would include the pages of the genetic code , just to get this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus , and it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier when you &apos;re in the world &apos;s way , and you &apos;re just going to take the nucleus out and there &apos;s another one in , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about pessimism .
and in the world &apos;s chromosome , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but we &apos;ve shown that you can have a complete transplant of a particle to another , and that can turn out .
we &apos;re going to get the chromosome of a computer , and it &apos;s roughly , and it &apos;s the two of these two times away from people and mice , we gave some of these chromosome to the chromosome , and it was very amazing than we gave it to the cell -- and it was very amazing than we gave it to a cell -- and it was very amazing than we gave it to a cell -- and it was very amazing than we gave it to a cell -- and it was very amazing than we
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that here &apos;s the end , but we tried to bring the process to a little bit .
this is the most important thing of evolution here .
we all find the species of species here , or a third chromosome , or a third of the world &apos;s , every time thousands of characteristics in just one second .
so people who have changed evolution as a gene is being missed by the time .
there are enzymes called the most of the dna that actually is dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve added .
it was in the cell , and it realized the other chromosome as foreign material , and we had a cell on the end of a new chromosome .
it &apos;s a blue thing that we &apos;ve added to the genes that we &apos;ve added .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species and transformed completely into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we have .
it may sound like genomic , but we can , by moving the most dramatic , things quite dramatic .
now , i have a lot of the things that this is not the most important thing .
and i have been able to put that in the way that we might be able to create a new form of the accumulation of the blast explosion in which it could be massive new .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re in the next 40 billion people in the next 40 years .
to ask it to be in my relationship , i was born in the year in 1992 .
today , three people are in this planet for every year , in the last year , in the last year , it &apos;s going to be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for a hundred billion people .
it will offer a challenge for nine .
we need about five billion tons of coal , and we need to have a billion million barrels of oil , which is a hundred million barrels of land day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace it , it will be a huge challenge .
and then , of course , there &apos;s the whole co2 of this material in the atmosphere .
so we have now , from our discoveries of all over the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the most powerful ones of the future .
the most recent , a dozen components , and look at the diversity of that .
we &apos;re going to be in first line in the borders of biological reality and on the idea of our imagination .
we have technologies today because of this fast , and we have to do that with what we call the genetics .
we have a big robot to build the millions of chromosomes on the day .
if you think of these 20 million different genes , or to optimize these processes to make a $ small or drugs , we can change with a little bit more molecular language than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just a lot of selection , and we can get to the most of the time , production of chemicals or the way that we &apos;re doing .
this is a shot of real , very much of the real design we &apos;re working on , and we &apos;re actually designing new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to look like their genetic code .
we &apos;re now focusing on fuel of the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn in the sierra of the arab , which is just a bad experiment .
we have fuel of the most remote and third generation that will come out of the relatively much higher , as the way that we &apos;re going to have a lot of more than the ones , like , or different types of the world &apos;s .
but , as we think the only way to think about biology is a big impact without any more increase of the cost of food or the shake of their availability , if we see co2 as a result , we &apos;re working on cells that go to this path , and we work on cells that go to this path , and we &apos;re working on cells that go to this path , and we &apos;re working on cells that go to this path , and we &apos;re working on cells that go to this path , and we
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first with the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and that in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method -- a method --
but in our discovery , we have all kinds of different ways .
this is a organism we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about a mile , in almost a way of the time , almost in the middle of the world .
it &apos;s increasing co2 in methane around the use of hydrogen as a source of protein .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use co2 co2 , which could just be brought to the most remote , tangible , the co2 in fuel to make this process .
within a short period of time , we could think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- the targets of the whole fishing industry , and , if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where you can &apos;t do that in ted , where else ? a leader of energy .
but we &apos;re working on this right now , the same approaches for development .
they &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year , and you have a dollar to little , if it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that &apos;s going to be changed by being able to create vaccines in the world &apos;s own .
this is what the future might look like with changes , today , the most of the time , is accelerating with synthetic bacteria , and perhaps the most powerful .
we &apos;re able to improve people from it to improve people , and our goal is that we have a chance to survive for a long time to do that . thank you very much .
in the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to get back to you how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far . and for all those who are not there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that ever had been the most scientific experiment -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that have less than a second of the universe , and that to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking subtle .
this is the machine below geneva .
we take images of these of these types of water in detectors .
i &apos;m working on this work . he calls atlas detector -- 44 meters in the wide , 22 feet in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of atlas in the construction of the construction of it .
at september september last year , the machine went to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it &apos;s a huge huge amount of water in the control of the control .
it &apos;s a picture of the first of the first , which is the entire track to make the lhc , then with a part of the lhc , to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture at the 10th september , we knew that the machine works , what &apos;s a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this is created the largest most , or that , as someone went to the google side , and the front page of the page .
it means we reached a cultural impact next to scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires .
these wires lead to the same , when the machine goes on the world &apos;s machine .
now , the engineers are going to look at them and say , &quot; no that &apos;s not doing it . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you &apos;re very much more cold , you will be called the so-called more cold .
so in minus degrees , more polite than the space between the stars , these wires can be able to make tension .
in one of the connections , between over the magnet , there was a kind of a computer .
and so , it &apos;s the wires that are going to fit up and get a lot of the wires out of it .
this was the result .
well , this is even a wonderful thing when you imagine that the magnet weigh over 20 tons and expand about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnet .
and they had to remove what we did .
we &apos;re called it new , and they &apos;re going to be .
they &apos;re all back to their way .
and the end of march is going to be the lhc again .
we will turn it down , and we can collect the first data in june or july , and we &apos;re going to put our journey on the way that the building blocks are the building blocks .
now , of course , on a way of looking at accidents , the debate of science and engineering is in such borders . it &apos;s easy to hang out .
i think that it &apos;s so hard that it &apos;s so hard to reach out of our limits , and the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words , and i &apos;m going to leave you with a english scientist , and i &apos;m going to be a teenager , which is how i suspect when he was the most , his apprentice was michael &apos;s , and that &apos;s what we say , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to development . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
books are my profession , but it &apos;s of course more than that .
it &apos;s also my big life , love love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change that .
but the recent thing is a little bit weird in my life and my career , which has been brought me to this work completely .
this is a little bit of the event that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called the &quot; a biography of the day , &quot; the love of the day , love , love , and i was going to get a big , big , international , international , international , international , international , international , international , international , international , international , international , international , international , international , international , international , international , international , international , international , international , international , international , international , international , international ,
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to get treated as if i was the emperor of the placenta .
seriously -- the lucifer .
for example , they &apos;re going to be worried about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that success never will be going to be done ?
don &apos;t you have a fear of your life , and you never create a book , which is the anyone in the world ? never again ?
okay , that &apos;s really the courage .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago than i was a teenager for the first time i told you that i was going to be writer with the same kind of a little bit of the kind of kind of thing .
people said , &quot; did you have no fear to have never succeeded ? &quot;
did you not fear that you kill the eternal one letter ?
did you not feel a fear that you &apos;re going to live on this craft for a long time and never get something that you &apos;re going to die on a computer system -- your mouth filled with the mexican forest of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : the other thing .
yeah , i &apos;ve scared all of these things .
and i always had .
and i &apos;ve got a lot more things that nobody would be afraid of .
as algae -- and other frightening things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it for recently and ask me , why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that by someone should be expected to do that he &apos;s scared to do work that he feels like ?
and what &apos;s the creative enterprise that you &apos;re doing is that they &apos;re insecure about the most promising brain .
my father , for example , was chemist and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years , where he was afraid to be scared .
with your favorite , john -- how do you go to it ?
it was just not , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemist has not given the reputation of the world &apos;s centuries of the world .
but we seem to have a writer , but we have this kind of reputation , but not only the writers , but the creative of all the species seem to be mentally unstable .
everything you need to do is , the unemployed of really great heads of really great heads of the 20th century , which died young and often .
and even those who don &apos;t actually have a lot of money , seemed to be really neglected by their talent .
norman : shortly before his death in his last interview , the most of my books have been killed me a little bit further .
a remarkable statement that you can do about your life .
but we &apos;re not even going to say if we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve been familiar with this kind of talk for this as long as we &apos;ve been familiar with .
the question i want to ask today is this idea for you to do it in order to do it right ?
you know , you know , it &apos;s a little bit like that ? because with just one centimeter , i &apos;m not feeling about this notion of all of the time .
i find them .
and i find it dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how you get taken into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we encourage our big creative creative .
and i definitely know that it &apos;s for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , start , that dark path of view , sort of , in the fact i &apos;m in my career .
that &apos;s -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 of the other 40 years .
and it &apos;s very likely to be that everything i &apos;m going to write from now from the world as the work is going to be done for the world &apos;s work .
i say it &apos;s a lot of the friends , because we &apos;re all kind of friends here -- it &apos;s very likely to be that my greatest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that can bring someone to go to nine o &apos;clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to .
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of the most time , i seems to be able to write to write a kind of a kind of a psychological psychological building .
and i think i have to find out from a way to write a safe distance to the real distance between me and my very natural , very natural , like the reaction to the writing .
while i was looking for models for models , to do that , i &apos;ve been looking at the past , and i tried to find other societies to see if you might help better or more than we can help , with creativity .
this search led me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will end up again .
but in the old greece , rome , the people don &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they thought creativity was a kind of high school system that was from a distant , unknown source of people -- from the most distant , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this claes , the bureaucratic of creativity of creativity .
by socrates , it &apos;s known that he believed it , he would have a computer who was going to be able to get him away from the further .
the roman idea had the same idea , called this kind of creative mind , a kind of creative genius .
this is great . the roman didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
they thought that a genius was the kind of magical creature , from believed that it was literally in the walls of a computer -- about like this , the most , the most remarkable , and the result of work would design the work of work .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological building that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artist of the most powerful thing was protected , how much of the things , for example , to a lot of the other things , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you don &apos;t look at everything for you , everybody knew that you had this kind of genius that helped you .
if your work is -- not completely your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew her genius was a little paralyzed .
so the people in the west really thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance came and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- over all the gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no space more for the horror creatures , the orders of the mexican creatures , and there &apos;s no space .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational , and the people started to believe that creativity came completely from their individual individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people that or these artists call a genius -- instead of that he has a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a great mistake .
you know , i think , i think , a naked person , he thinks he thinks he &apos;s or it &apos;s like the head , like the the the the the the and the essence of all the , creative , intense , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite , infinite ,
it &apos;s like to ask someone to eat the sun .
and it &apos;s all that it &apos;s going to be done and a pipeline all the egos and it creates all these scores of expectations .
i think that this is the most important one of our artists , the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true .
can we change it ?
maybe to a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and mystery of creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just be rational from 500 years of the time , not just in a computer talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience , which would really be a really , really , scientific doubt , which is basically the idea of -- basically -- -- the people who are practicing and the most , etc .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to address is : why not ?
why not think about this ?
because it &apos;s a lot of sense of everything that i &apos;ve heard when it was about that , the absolutely crazy thing to explain of the creative process .
a process that &apos;s going to be -- like everyone knows that it &apos;s ever tried to make something -- so in other words : actually , everybody here -- not always , really , is not a reasonable investment .
in fact , he can feel really a really bad thing .
i had a encounter as i met the extraordinary american poet , which is now , which is about 90 , which is the most , but she told me that she was going to be able to feel like she was born in the fields . she said she was going to feel like a poem on the fields . she said she was going to feel like a poem . she said she was going to feel like a poem .
she was saying it would be like a car train .
the country on them would be in the country .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet to the quake .
she knew that they could only do one moment , and that was -- in their words -- the head of running running .
they ran like the devil for the house as they were tracking from this poem , and it was just that they had to get fast enough to get a sheet of paper and a pen to get it through it , and they could keep it on the sheet .
in other people , they didn &apos;t paint fast enough . they ran and ran and ran , but they didn &apos;t get the house through them and they were going to put it through the land and they were going to be . she would say it would go to land .
and then there was these moments -- the part of the part i never forget -- she said that there were moments where they were almost given .
so , she runs to the house and addiction after paper and the poem through them and it picks up a pen as it &apos;s through her and then -- she said -- it was like this .
she was carrying the poem on his tail and moved back to her body and took it on the sheet of paper .
and this is the poem that came out of the poem , intact and intact on paper -- but backwards -- the last word for the first .
when i thought that i thought that &apos;s a very amazing -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is happening .
that &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a kind of a computer , and i &apos;m going to be able to get to work every day , and sweat , and i really sweat , and really uncomfortable .
but even i &apos;ve been in my favorite room sometimes .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
even i had work or ideas that come from a source of me , which i really cannot identify .
what is this thing for a thing ?
and how do we get to lose with the relationship without losing our minds , but in the opposite of the way , we &apos;re in the opposite of mental health ?
for me , the best living example , how to do this can make the musicians , tom , i was going to interview him a few years ago .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of his life was tom &apos;s embodiment of modern artists who tried to be trying to be able to do this kind of creative impulses , and to put them in the way .
but then he became older and quiet . he told me that he went to a white room in los angeles , and there &apos;s everything changed for him .
he was going to be a little bit of a little bit of a marker of a melody , which is what it &apos;s like in inspiration , for him , for a spectacular , hard , and he &apos;s going to have it . it &apos;s not a matter of it . he &apos;s not going to get it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have pen , he doesn &apos;t have a pen .
so he starts to go to this old , and he &apos;s going to go to this thing like that , like , i &apos;m going to lose this thing and will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get on this song .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of taking into panic , he just heard .
he finished all the whole train and did something completely new .
he just looked at the sky and said , &quot; do you see sorry , can you see that i drive car ? &quot;
so , i &apos;m looking at this as a song , i &apos;m going to just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a moment of a moment , if i can care about you .
if not , you can do somebody else .
go and go to the royal anne cohen .
his whole characteristic has changed after that .
not the work itself . that was always as dark as ever as much as ever as well as ever .
but the process and the heavy of the heavy , which is the most difficult thing that he was looking at was the genius of where he was not doing any trouble , and he was left where he was going to come from . he realized that it had no more a more , more , more , a little bit .
it could be a more sophisticated , surprising , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the authentic , which was not quite tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit like i worked and i &apos;ve been saved .
and this idea was saved as i was in the middle of the middle of the world &apos;s middle of the world &apos;s in the middle of the world , and i was a love of doubt . i fell in one of these statements of doubt in the one of the things that we &apos;re all going to do , and it &apos;s not going to be done .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just be the project .
but then i remembered how tom had spoken in the free sky and i tried it .
so i raised my view of the manuscript and talked to my comment towards a blank corner of the room .
i was talking about it , and i &apos;m going to hear , you know , you and i know both if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see , i &apos;m all , what i &apos;ve got , i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to put up here and you have to get your percentage of the deal .
okay . but , if you don &apos;t do that ... you know what , then the heck of it .
i &apos;m going to write on the way that it &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you a record of the jobs that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like follows . centuries of centuries in the deserts are people to get to the desert of the proton , and music killed the hours -- until the dawn .
these are always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , very rare , something special happened . one of the actors was actually a lot of the actors .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you all have seen a performance in your life .
it was as a time , and the dancers are going to be a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of thing , and he did nothing else than he did before -- 1,000 nights before . but everything added together .
and it didn &apos;t seem to be more human .
he was in the inside of light and the bottom of light and everything is going through a wider fire .
as something happened at the time , people knew what was that . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : the senior play-doh , pop , diamonds , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historical , as the most popular , brought them to this need , and the extended thing was that the extended thing changed in the course of the centuries of the world &apos;s own , and the senior , the , and i hear it in the other hand .
if a christian in spain , something horrible has done : the magic of the , , is , the senior , the , , , , , , , , is , the great , great , great , very , very , very , a glimpse of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning , when the dancer wake himself and see that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he doesn &apos;t have a more of god &apos;s .
he &apos;s just an aging of the knee with a lot of the knee , and maybe he &apos;s never going to go back to this heights .
and maybe someone &apos;s name is called god &apos;s name , if it &apos;s going to be . but what do he do with the rest of his life ?
this is hard .
this is one of the most powerful contributions of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be very much of the violin if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence is coming from them .
if you might just believe that they &apos;re a questionnaire -- from a spectacular source for a more powerful source of their life , who &apos;s going to be passed on somebody else when they &apos;re done .
if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and i think i was working with safety in the last months while i worked on the book , which is soon going to appear -- as the dangerous , scary , very expected to my favorite success .
what i &apos;ve got to say is , if i &apos;m going to be crazy about it , it &apos;s not fear .
not a cartoonist .
do your job .
it &apos;s still for your contribution , which is whatever he might be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the dumb acceleration of genius , you &apos;re asking to the side , decides to show a very short one of miracles through your effort , then , the most , more , more , more , more , more , a lot of the time .
and if not , dance still dance your dance .
and the most , more , a lot of the time .
i think i think that &apos;s what we should do , we should teach that .
and the most , in the way , is to be a lot of the time , and the most , just for you , is that you &apos;re the mere human love and the most remote , for that .
thank you .
thank you .
and the most , in the way !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic arctic , which was nearly three million years , had the size of the lower 48 states to get 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t push very enough to do the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic is the the origin of our global heart .
she grows in winter and a picture in summer .
the next slide i show you is a kind of a more of what happened in the last 25 years .
the most is the most red thing to be transported .
as you see , it grows on the dark . this is the annual ice in winter ; it &apos;s the summer in summer .
the so-called the so-called the , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which is from the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here .
this is a problem , because warming is frozen to the arctic ocean , which is big amounts of water , which is , if he &apos;s going to be done , from microbes to methane .
compared to the entire amount of things in the atmosphere , that amount of amount of information could double , if we cross this critical point .
now , today , in some flat lakes in alaska , methane is from itself from the water .
professor , walter walter &apos; university in alaska , is to have another flat sea last winter .
wow !
you &apos;re good . the question is , how will it be us .
and one reason is , this enormous heat is the outer temperature of greenland .
this is a long time .
but the volume are much bigger than ever before .
this is the most late river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the sea level goes through the sea , you &apos;re going to get into the sea .
these rivers take fast .
the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest largest largest on the planet .
last month , researchers were reported that the entire continent has a negative .
and the most powerful , the ones that came up with a few of the things that are very strong is particularly very strong .
this is 20 feet sea sea , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the most remote , you see the top of new lakes , the top of a few years ago .
40 percent of all people on the world get half of their favorite systems from this kind of thing .
in the suburbs , this glacier is the most remote thing for this city .
the most dramatic thing has been expanding .
but if you &apos;re going to get the most of the water , most of the drinking water .
in california , a 40 percent reduction of the sierra growth of sierra .
this is the most important thing .
and the predictions , how they read them , are serious .
this is the most dramatic increase in the world to fire a dramatic increase .
and the disasters everywhere in the world have never been in a really sophisticated and before , and before it never has a subtle degree .
four times in the last 30 years as in the world &apos;s most .
this is a completely more powerful thing .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s going to be done .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve created 70 million tons of co2 , all 24 million tons of co2 every day in the oceans .
look at the area of eastern pacific , from american continent west and groups of indian , where it &apos;s a radical decline of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest one factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the nonetheless of the biggest biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest largest things , together with china .
and the suggestion was to build many more of the other things .
but we start seeing a change .
here &apos;s the ones that were taken in the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
and there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the most , the most , and the most , a dollar dollar , spent a dollar dollar , to make clean coal , which is already a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me something .
to go around christmas , at home , in tennessee , a billion tons of tons of tons of water .
they &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is in our entire country of the world &apos;s land .
this happened to christmas .
one of the ads of the most of the the christmas of the christmas to christmas was this .
the most of the time the most , a little bit of a sudden , is a happy guy .
there &apos;s a skin in the skin and a lot of the other people in america , and he helps our economy to grow .
and the most little day , the most little day is clean .
he &apos;s affordable and the workers remain in high school and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful thing is the ladder of the world &apos;s head .
let me tell you a very clear one . al gore , nancy , harry hunt , you don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection has two teas in life .
this is one part of her .
in the world &apos;s most , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
so we put it on the top of the top , to spend a significant , significant , a major amount of a time to bring a sense of coal to the truth of coal .
the fact is , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s still good .
so , do you don &apos;t worry about climate change .
leave that quiet .
and coal coal , they &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean of the clean .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean .
and yet , the burning of coal &apos;s population is the global warming , which is remarkable clean , which you see here , everything changes .
look at it exactly , this is the clean , clean .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis that economics , the national security system , the climate crisis .
the red cafe , which all connects that , is our dependence of the dependence of the fuel of the fuel as dirty coal and the oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us from this kind of thing .
and the other of the other is clean .
a plan , america to make us secure , to help us to stop the global warming .
finally , a solution , the big enough , is to solve our problems .
and the other thing is , the other thing is new . find more out .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a more of the u.s. .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence of old , dirty fuels , which are our world transplant .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to make good jobs .
and the other thing is , the other thing is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s a old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , you go alone .
if you want to come far away , go together . &quot;
we have to come far , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start asking you to ask the time of her childhood , when she played with the most of the time .
while you realized how to get the hands and the hands , the most remote , and it &apos;s actually moving , and they actually learned to think about and change problems through understanding and change the other thing .
the spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- together with my favorite , and my colleagues , i started to wonder , i started to wonder what if we could use computers , which would be like a digital .
this question was so emotional that we decided to study the answer and developed the answer .
shortly , a more interactive computer is a interactive computer in the size of a computer .
you can move with your hand , you can perceive each other , you can detect your movements and you have a screen and a screen .
much more importantly , are physically , why you &apos;re just going to get them through the fall of the hands and access .
and the most , the example of a new generation of a new generation of the manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools are going to be , and a conscious awareness of their movements are going to recognize each other and see the top of our own system with them , then we can start with the exploration of new and more potent .
i start with some simple examples .
this is the most important thing for the most remote , and when i put it into a direction , the video is going forward , if i &apos;m in the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits are taking each other true .
so if i put them next to you , you &apos;re doing interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the most , you notice that , and you can be a nervous thing .
and they also feel their movements and the tendency .
a interesting consequence of interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures to data like that , like color , how to do this with liquid .
in this case , we have three main people as a more of the most , and i can use them to put color into the middle of where they &apos;re going to mix .
if we go to it , we can do a little bit of a little bit .
there are also some nice opportunities in education like languages , math or the most , where we give people the opportunity to see the opportunity of fast trial and the results immediately want to see .
here i am ... this is a fibonacci numbers i &apos;m doing with a simple job of a simple job .
this is a game with words that is a mixture of a mixture of the brain and the most complex .
basically , you get any round on every single level of music , and you &apos;re trying to form words , to make this over a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , it &apos;s going to be done and try and try a new way of thinking .
thank you .
these are some kids who came to the media lab , and i could move it to try and get a video of it .
they really loved it .
a more interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
everything you have to say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest main system down there .
it turns out he wanted to just stack the most little .
so for him , they were just more likely .
this is an interactive thing .
we wanted to develop a more of the most remote for a lot of the time .
this is adaptive .
he can bring new characters into the scene by putting the the table from the table , which shows this character .
here he does the sun .
the sun goes on on the sun goes on on the sun .
now he &apos;s going to get a stephanie in the scene .
the orange stephanie .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the most , and you can put them next to the characters .
... his own story invent .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open and he can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example i &apos;ve been having today , to show it is a kind of a , for a while , which we &apos;ve developed recently and in the world &apos;s most recently as a sound , like the way that we &apos;re doing , and the drums .
every four different variations , you can pick up what you want to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can organize in any patterns .
and you &apos;re going to get them to take a little bit of a more , a little bit of a time .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filter .
you connect it with a certain tone and then it tends to be a lot of the time .
and then even more basic effects like speed and volume that you &apos;re doing on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s look at .
we start to start in the two of the most remote , and that in a series of organizing , they expand and add a little more of the voice .
now i add a container bag .
now i &apos;m going to do a little edible to do it .
and now i &apos;m going to go to the barefoot , so i can control the effect live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by putting the speed into one or another direction .
and now i &apos;m going to go to the filter with the bass ; for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as you can change .
and i don &apos;t have to plan it in the front of it , but it can improvise ; it &apos;s turning out or lower .
and finally , i can take the whole sequence by being affected by the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my excitement is to develop new amounts of new zealand , which is better to fit how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new new school and some of the possibilities that we work in our lab .
the idea i want to give you to the way is that we &apos;re at the threshold to the new generation of the interaction to the interaction with digital media , which is the information in our world , which is our demands .
thank you very much , thank you , thank you very much .
i &apos;m very pleased to talk to you about all of them .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;m very pleased to be there .
yeah , so what should be more like ?
i have to just take a little bit of back , and it &apos;s busy to be a lot of the modern molecular molecular biology .
i study molecular molecular biology and i &apos;ve been doing a few years now with the most few years , and i started to do that because i just wanted to know and do it in front of the way that i was studying relativity theory .
so that was my primary motivation .
so it was an curiosity and i wanted to get closer to the matter , so .
i think the molecular molecular biology now , so in general , talked about biotechnology , all you &apos;re counting , synthetic biology and so on , so on , synthetic biology and so on , so on , so on , synthetic biology and so on , etc .
extremely important , now , is extremely important , and much more , much more important in the future .
there &apos;s so hard things like this all the time that we have all the time in the world .
there are now craig venter in the world &apos;s most , which tries to make a difference of algae , so gas from algae .
and then there &apos;s also things that are totally in the everyday life , which is most people , but they don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on to us , for example , to wash us with 40 degrees of laundry , also , more likely to wash enzymes .
and the list can continue to continue .
and so from interest , that technology is , i &apos;m going to go on to the other .
so what &apos;s what &apos;s been done now ?
most people know that most people know that from the most of the time .
computers are drawn , and then it will always be like that , yes , the hackers break somewhere and so on .
this is kind of very sad for the most sad , because it doesn &apos;t matter what it actually is like , and what &apos;s actually behind it .
and that &apos;s the most , in the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , and it &apos;s also taken the internet .
and it &apos;s about an playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can just be a more of what things like , so a question , a question , and how can you make it better .
and it &apos;s been just a little bit of software with software , but there &apos;s also in the most remote , because there &apos;s also a whole whole thing that &apos;s going to make all sorts of things that are all kinds of things .
and now , in terms of biology , and i want to be able to get this metaphor , which comes out of synthetic biology , take that biology is actually a more abstract code , because it &apos;s a matter of the way that it is , it &apos;s not a very equal code , and it &apos;s not just the same thing .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it and you can also program it , and that &apos;s what i found , and that &apos;s what i found , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper to get .
that &apos;s actually just a lot of the other days , that these networks are really .
there &apos;s a lot of the constellations of the way that &apos;s originally from switzerland , which is in switzerland , and with cooperation in india , which is now members of the world , but now , members of the world .
that &apos;s a more artistic , so there &apos;s a lot of artists , and it &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and collaboration with scientists with scientists , and they &apos;re asking to make it creative , and they &apos;re creative , and they &apos;re doing it , and they &apos;re all possible .
but it &apos;s actually about finding a more of the way that a kind of a more , a playful deal with that .
and then there &apos;s a snapshot of the cpu , and then , the most of the time .
this is from the most of the world &apos;s network that is actually more like this , which is a kind of forum where you &apos;re going to stop and discuss online .
these are a little more sophisticated , and also a little bit of a little bit more sophisticated , and then , you know , the way that we &apos;re going to ask , is , yes , the final question .
and from these networks , the whole popular , it has been developed , has been developed as a scene that i want to be able to do .
here in the left , you see the top of the top , that &apos;s a kind of a kind of a school , so basically a kind of school , a private school , nonprofit agency , where everybody can get .
children , old , all kinds of people are going to go to that , just to be able to put it in a lab , and you see what can do if these are the most powerful ones .
here &apos;s a group on the left , and the one group is called the , which is , but there &apos;s quite a long time .
longer than these other networks .
and the way that we &apos;re doing is in a artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , also , and combine it in pretty much ways .
a group of seoul i met a while ago , which is a little bit of a time that would be the public , which would be the public , which they learn in college , and they tried to explain the other thing that &apos;s going on .
and i have a lecture on the other picture in copenhagen in copenhagen in the medical museum in the combination of a show .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s mostly young people , but the only thing that all of the things that all of all together , is that fascination of technology .
and what you can do with that , and it &apos;s also going to be a lot of the way to do that , and to ask the society , so , okay , what do you want to do , you have interest with that ?
so , okay , to be able to put biology , you need to do some kind of material .
you need biological materials , and you need to have tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
or , you know , what you usually understand under a lab is that somehow , these are kind of a kind of kind of thing that &apos;s kind of a lot of things that are very expensive , extremely expensive , very , very , very , very intense academic , and so on .
and our approach was to say , okay , that actually , you have to do that .
that &apos;s not necessary because every one of every single one of every single one of every single one of the most people have developed technology as most of the most common things that are really like that .
and the o premise with this premise has been trying to be in england , for example , a scientist , and a , a , has taken a , and then , , , yes , a little bit , and , yes , and then , it &apos;s been designed to be bacteria .
so every one , that &apos;s a soup of soup that he &apos;s left to long , even once .
i tried to do this in my lab , a little bit , and then i &apos;ve bought a little bit of the way on ebay and a little bit of analysis , and so , a test , so that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and then to make home .
now , that should not be a joke , but it &apos;s not a joke .
so here &apos;s what &apos;s going on in the picture , you see the lab , in the world , so it &apos;s a kind of a garage , so that &apos;s a kind of a garage that has the university of the college , which has a group of what &apos;s called what &apos;s called what &apos;s called what &apos;s called what &apos;s called what &apos;s called what &apos;s called what &apos;s called what &apos;s called what &apos;s called what &apos;s called what &apos;s called what &apos;s called what &apos;s called what &apos;s called what &apos;s called what &apos;s
and this is a little bit of the time that mentioned that , that &apos;s what &apos;s known as a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of molecular biology .
and yes , you see , it &apos;s relatively diverse , so there &apos;s a little bit of people who are doing that alone , and so far to the big organizations that are going to be in the same way .
but always the approach that it &apos;s just going to be easy and accessible .
the first project we &apos;ve done as an international group , as we were basically aware of our self , is , ok , there are now as a scene , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people that are always getting more and so .
and then , from the world &apos;s website , the founder of the founder , and he said , well , we have to actually meet ourselves , also , really , really , really , and then , two events , and a little bit of it in the southern world , in san francisco .
and , then , there &apos;s also about that , right , who are we , what do we want to do , what do we want to tell ?
and what are our values and what are our heritage , our foundation ?
and then we &apos;ve been able to be able to make a more of the way .
that was quite intuitive , so everyone has just been the wishes , his and what it &apos;s moving , and then , then , then , then .
there was one of my opinion , i think , a very good code .
and then we have the one that is not a subtle , but that &apos;s the end , i think , i think , quite good , the people are right from this .
and we even tried to bring that into academic world , but it &apos;s kind of not going to come .
so i think we &apos;re actually in the way that we &apos;re in the way that the academic world .
yeah , what are we doing now ?
a project i did with the most of the time in switzerland , was that we wanted to make a call or optical .
that &apos;s when you focus a beam , on a room , you can capture little particles in the air , or in the liquid , and then in this focus , that &apos;s what &apos;s been captured , so , as a kind of kind of a kind of a principle in principle .
that &apos;s really what &apos;s done in academic science , and we thought , okay , that &apos;s what we might get , then we have a webcam that &apos;s going to be the lens , and then you have a microscope that &apos;s going to be a microscope .
this is what you see down there .
and then we have a kind of a tutor of a crater and the hyenas , and then i try to focus on this camera .
and that &apos;s not working , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of it .
so , a different project that &apos;s from the french group of paris , which has worked , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and it &apos;s a reason that he &apos;s a little bit like this , so a kind of a kind of a way , and so , it &apos;s a little bit like that , and so he &apos;s busy busy , his own is sam &apos;s .
he then built this helmet , and it &apos;s built in cooperation with the museum of the museum .
and then there could be the visitors in the room , put on this chair , put this helmet .
and then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought or how they thought , then they &apos;re different lights in the room .
was a pretty much very much project .
another thing from the united states , which is also with this kind of thing to do with this kind of thing , is the most powerful , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , to reproduce , to reproduce , to reproduce , so you can make them visible .
so , if i do that , the most remote thing that the most popular the crime is , then , go to the crime , they &apos;re going to collect any of these things , and then they can make this method , and then they can say , okay , this hair , and so , the hair .
and the machines that are doing something like that is quite expensive that you buy commercial , the cheapest , the cheapest .
and that &apos;s not the end of the world , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be a lot of it .
so that &apos;s just a application of many , which you can do with it .
and that &apos;s where two orphans have been in the two of these two orphans , and i said , okay , that &apos;s what we do , and then we have a open source , and then they &apos;re going to have the most remote of these devices , and they &apos;re now the cheapest dissonance of these devices .
i think somehow so short or something like this .
but it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s in a frame of a frame where it &apos;s going to be clear .
so , it &apos;s my opinion of a very more of a tutor .
a project i started to build was a computer of building .
and the way is , yes , like this kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of a .
you invites the most of the time on the top of the world and then the most remote , and then i have the most , and then i &apos;ve got the light on the foyer and then then brought the light to the light .
so the device you see there is not working .
but this is my prototype , but that &apos;s pretty much considered a hurricane , so on a branch , which is what , electronics , and pressure , and that was the pressure too high , but it was the pressure too high .
and then i took a computer system and i &apos;ve been able to get it out .
a more of the time , if you do the full power with water , the enough pressure , so i think , so 40 to a half , i think , is about 40 to a half .
and then you can then accelerate the particles , and then they go into the marines .
and the commercial device costs about the most of the euro , or something like this , and something like 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically doable .
and that &apos;s the moment that &apos;s the core of the scene that &apos;s the scene of the scene , and the availability of technology and the information and the information is that more people can get there .
because , as the beginning said , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of that and also not a chance to form it .
because , if you read about it , it &apos;s not the same thing , as if you &apos;ve done it yourself or seen it .
and i think technology is always more important in our modern societies .
and if you can make a informed citizen , you can make a lot of choices in society , and you can want to be able to do the access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it , and you know , to make it and understand it .
and then the most remote thing about the top open of open and citizen science .
so , you know , you &apos;re going to get a citizen in the situation , and it &apos;s going to be a scientific technology .
and that &apos;s the core of the most profound thing .
these are the people who have been officially officially approved on the website , and they &apos;re the website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and interesting is also that they &apos;re also represented in southeast asia .
that &apos;s me , that &apos;s there , there are fewer people who are there , as actually .
so i know some of the ones that don &apos;t have .
and these are just the drums that individual people .
in part of these kinds of things , this is where these places are there .
and that &apos;s very in the beginning .
as said , it &apos;s just started .
and so , the most , the most , the most , because the most , the most , in berlin , was the first , the first one .
and that &apos;s a gigantic network now in very good , yes , the whole thing that are in the world .
and we hope we &apos;re going to be able to be able to expand and then also connected to it , so that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do , that &apos;s more people involved in the way .
and i would invite everyone to do with it and even try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible if you have enough curiosity , and you &apos;re going to get enough energy , then you get it far .
thank you for listening .
this was it .
yeah , hello .
how do we work in humans ?
this is a question that &apos;s moving me very much as designers , but in the area of the world , and all of the things in the region of user users .
there &apos;s about how to have people in interactive media , so they can use these interactive media and create it to a whole more of the experience .
so , i think that the interactive media in us are in our own , cognitive models , so paradigm , which has been a very , very long time , and that we can just make the same through interactive media .
and that &apos;s very amazing because you actually believe that these are the most powerful ones you &apos;ve seen there , that the future is actually bringing it into the future , but it &apos;s that the future is exactly in us , in our own roots .
what are the models of the models ?
i &apos;ve got four of the pieces of water and wants to explain the short thing .
and to the cognitive cognitive models , that &apos;s the models that we have in the 1920s times .
to these of the models that we heard that we have a basically natural relationship to the craft .
it &apos;s basically unusual .
i &apos;m going to go back to it , and you &apos;ll see it , and you &apos;ll prove it to you that they have natural relationship to nyu .
the second aspect is that we &apos;ve been able to be able to talk about this kind of models of models in the situation , and we &apos;re very , very , very , very , very , very , very , a more , very , a language of language .
and the third area , which explains actually from itself .
we all know that the interactive media is the definition of definition , which involves the denial of the limited , and what we say is that we &apos;re going to feel the strong way of normal .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of the world &apos;s place .
so , as it is with the craft , that &apos;s actually the most natural thing that &apos;s the world .
i want to prove that to you .
how many doors did the house have been living in the way that they live ?
that &apos;s not going to be a mess , but it &apos;s going to be able to be able to do that , but it &apos;s going to happen right now .
they go through the spirit of this house , in the middle of the house , they &apos;re living , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what you do .
they &apos;re the reality and it &apos;s not computers .
fantastic , right ?
and we &apos;re going to have to have the virtual reality in our own , and we can actually show the virtual reality in our own system .
and this is the virtual that the virtual reality that has the reality of the reality , which has been needed to have the people in the tracks , because they had nothing .
and that didn &apos;t have books .
or not a no more than no one .
they didn &apos;t have mass mass mass mass .
the only thing that had had was her head .
and in this head , the memory was playing .
in this head , the way that we know is , in this head , the way that the virtual images were , the imagination , were also passed to know .
and so it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with the craft so well .
the interesting thing about it is if i can make a little trip .
yes , that &apos;s .
the interesting thing about this is that the human being is the world &apos;s same time and medium itself .
now if you &apos;re going to think of a piece of a piece .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i &apos;ll talk to you about it again .
central tool of the world &apos;s problems have been since , for example .
and the priest , priests , so-called the so-called , were extra to preserve knowledge in stories .
and now we &apos;re still going to depend on stories .
the author of the book the book of the book , jonathan , is , we still move a year to the year of stories .
that means for a child that &apos;s going to be spent the most of the time of the most time of his life with the most of the time .
now we think of our love to stories that we were sitting in the lap of our parents .
no , no , far missing .
this is a lot further back to the cultures of the world &apos;s cultures .
but for me , in the interactive media , as a particularly impressive , we have been able to make it a break of the power of our biological memory , the ability to think of the ability to think .
i brought you a example of the north american tribe .
and life lived in the world &apos;s life of british columbia .
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very powerful area , and you had to navigate there , from iceland to island to get food .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s called the so-called &quot; the &quot;
you might know , maybe if you &apos;re interested in this , you know , a little bit of the australian american .
and they have similar principles .
they have no more than that , but they have used the same as well as they have .
and what the interesting thing about is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be implemented over songs .
and the language of the language was being approved by the language .
that means you &apos;re going to be a sound about sound and rhythm .
and this sounds and this rhythm , the geology , the topography of a region , and that &apos;s also allowing you to put these songs and put it on the left , and then to go back to the left , and then move back to the left .
why don &apos;t we sing to get out of a b to b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
it &apos;s that that &apos;s so much the way that comes out .
we &apos;ve moved to the so-called &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s the book .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens , that we have responsibility for our memories and the own production of our individual memories on external media .
on the book and on the picture .
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of god to get a piece of a little bit more .
thom is suddenly alien for us , and it has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous known one on the most long , is that this organization was gone , and he says that this organization , and so the picture , so , not the internet , and so on , we have the ability to have our memories of our memories , and our ability to be able to have our ability to be a mass of our memories .
let &apos;s make a little bit of a little bit .
from the world &apos;s machine , the machine machine .
what has influence on our thinking and our memory ?
then the most the effect of the the world &apos;s wiring are the opposite cultures .
and they &apos;re more than over centuries of centuries , and more of the impact of the impact .
that means instead of remember , we have a lot of common , far more common , in mass patterns of memories that we can depend on our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more itself .
we have an abstract language .
we don &apos;t ask the thing to do the things that are not more in pictures , but we &apos;re going to be able to do it our language .
we &apos;ve used that things that happen linear .
and we &apos;ve been accepted the more than law , and there &apos;s only exceptions , like the most primitive .
what &apos;s stayed is the most important thing .
still , we &apos;re the most , very , very arrested .
the question is , what &apos;s going on now ?
we had the most remote thing , we had the machine machine , and we &apos;re going to go to this so-called called the so-called so-called the so-called .
that sounds very much about the same , and it sounds very much science , i know .
but these concepts of the world &apos;s most , that brings us back to this opportunity to discover our skills again .
there &apos;s about malibu , it &apos;s about the most remote , it &apos;s about the most remote .
i want to explain a little bit about this .
there are technical concepts like the augmented reality , which is called the extended reality .
so if you look at google , for example , then , you see , a concept , which is the virtual world , which is the real world that is going to combine our physiological world , which is the virtual as a little normal , natural , natural , natural .
another example is called virtual reality .
so , of course , this is what &apos;s crazy in my talk , and we may be able to be physically , we &apos;re not going to be able to be virtual , virtual worlds , and the model of the world &apos;s model .
and other examples are the most powerful , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
all this needs to do the ability to accept our basic ability to accept puerto rico as a real habitat .
i &apos;ve been in the degree and i hope that video works , a very , very beautiful project , that &apos;s the most beautiful project , that &apos;s the most powerful thing , the most , more , more , more , more , more , more and more , more and more .
and the two of the things are here today .
maybe you can stand up , so you can get up to the break with the two of the project .
and this project i brought as an example of how again , as again as this was , cognitive models will be supporting .
the whole thing is , i have to say that .
what the most powerful thing of course is extremely powerful and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i say computer games , you have a very likely to have a lot of eyes , that any people have some people who are doing some people in front of a few of the things in the hand .
on every case , they &apos;re doing that in .
this is a game outside .
and that &apos;s the way that i think i found the outside world , so i think that i &apos;ve been able to discover the real world again .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data that we produce , which we produce with the real world .
i apologize that i have to get so strong .
you can explain that much better , because there &apos;s more much more behind it .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to discover a city by looking at what places have positive or negative .
and so i get a very different sight of the city , a very different impression , which i see negative and positive zones of a city and get a whole different one , virtual map of a very real city .
and we can now look at this .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you see .
of course , these virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , is clear .
and with a kind of flashlight , we can make this virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize my talk , and that &apos;s what the properties and the skills we &apos;ve been donated from the most remote , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been doing in the machine , and we &apos;re actually going to get to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be able to be able to be .
i &apos;ve been asked if this bag is a bag of bag , and i &apos;m going to talk to you instead of talking .
it &apos;s not going to do it .
i &apos;m also going to be able to get more likely to do what &apos;s inside .
but i just do it , just &quot; n little bit . &quot;
yes , kids are curious from nature or should be curious , designers also .
i &apos;m a creator of house , so i &apos;m also going to do with the subject of curiosity and how the curiosity is changing again , and why are we going to lose curiosity and so forth .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re doing next to the actual mind as a gay .
if professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to be in the n of the n .
and that &apos;s what i had last half year .
a problem for natural user interface .
now , you &apos;re going to ask , why are all the gay apes in the way that we &apos;re going to start with this natural , and the way that we &apos;re going to do is to do that .
and i just think of one of these little devices , because things should always be more intuitive , always natural , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually for us to do , of course , and what &apos;s the most important thing to do is , of course , or intuitive .
and i have a lot of the background in the area of natural user interface , so the next generation in the world is in the relationship of human computers in the relationship of the human computer , as our tools or how the computer is changing from the computer .
so i &apos;m busy , when it &apos;s what &apos;s of course , or intuitive .
maybe again , a look at it .
why does this happen at all ?
so if we look at the development of our society , here &apos;s a little bit shown , we &apos;re going to move from the third in the fourth world or a half .
so the modern in the world &apos;s most .
every society is shaped by a computer system .
the beginning of the language is the language .
that means you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve talked to a common language , you could communicate with each other , and in other areas , cities have been educated or villages and villages and villages .
but the most powerful thing was the language , something very natural , something very natural .
and you had to learn , so not a one-hour can talk about nature , but we learn it and of course , and of course .
that was then a way of the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a kind of a more , because of course , because of course , the living language began to animate the whole language of the script , which is what &apos;s called the thing , and i &apos;m going to start and i &apos;m going to go and get it into stone and i also do it .
depending on how i &apos;m going to be a lot of the time and when i was a lot of the time , of course , it &apos;s a very different narrative when it &apos;s a living .
but then , the fact was that the script was going to be a while , and it was got to be called .
then the next generation that we actually have today is even primarily .
this is just the pressure of pressure and print in the background , and other .
and then it was a very , very much , where the acorn , and other said , are you really crazy when people start reading , then , and of course , that &apos;s completely shaped .
and now we come to the next generation and the exciting , so a lot of a hundred years , and we &apos;re actually in this in this kind of a phase phase that we &apos;re doing this .
and of course , that &apos;s what we &apos;re confused to , of course , because we see the new media , the social media , facebook , facebook and so on .
with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what &apos;s going on to the old thinking , don &apos;t tell you that in the world &apos;s most , and no beef , and i want to just do it , and i want to just do it .
and these two worlds are expanding just together , new and old thinking .
the exciting thing about this is when you look at the doctor , these new society , these are a lot of mechanisms , principles , and the paradigm of the world &apos;s most powerful .
but not more on local level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the subject is a global economy .
not if i think of local , and the neighbor thinks less than it &apos;s going to be .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on from the local village actually has a global village with the same principles , of course , , of course , intuitive , but also the total transparency .
so as you knew in the village , who has what &apos;s got with who and when , that &apos;s what happens to the extent of our self through this mobile level of the world .
it &apos;s that we know global breeding and faster and faster and better .
so , as it was earlier , it happened to be a lot of time .
so , before the background , i &apos;m doing that , what is it called what &apos;s actually , because what &apos;s going on for us , what &apos;s going on , what &apos;s going on for us , but what &apos;s the difference of that is what makes the difference ?
because often people can &apos;t do it , and they can &apos;t do it , so everyone can deal with it .
so you have to deal with what &apos;s called , because it &apos;s not just changing it , but it &apos;s better to be better .
and when of course , something intuitive and how i can take a creator on it , and just the things that they &apos;re designing is that they &apos;re a a a more intuitive , so they &apos;re a very intuitive , and they &apos;re just using .
you &apos;re busy , even as the study of the perception , with the subject of perception and the most of the time .
and that &apos;s what you &apos;re starting to start and look at , and i &apos;m going to look at it , now i just look at the inner self .
and how does it actually look at it ?
so how do we work when we &apos;re going to get there ?
and what does it mean , of course , intuitive and how do our channels work in perception and how cognitive power works ?
because steve jobs said , you &apos;re going to be able to dig up to dig up to the most remote .
so you really have to look at the details if i want to make something more like a little bit more or intuitive , which is that it &apos;s in the core .
and you see , you know , you have a our seven senses , most of us think about five , now , it &apos;s actually seven , and it &apos;s still seven , and the next thing is , in the near future , and as an extension of our self .
and to look at how process is we taking information , how do we take information ?
and to say , what &apos;s information ?
information is every difference that is a difference .
many use that word , but not what it means to be detail .
but i have to understand in the core , in the nature , when it &apos;s going to be information , when information is going to be information , and from information , so i know how to do things like that , and of course , i can do things like that .
and of course , how design is influence to the perception .
we see that , if i make things , then i can design them like the right , and i don &apos;t know what &apos;s about salt and pepper , or i can make it sort of intuitive by making things .
so much natural , in a head , but i look at it directly where it &apos;s salt and pepper in the place .
and if i say someone , i &apos;ll give you salt or pepper , then he will think about where it &apos;s in the right .
and the left is just intuitive access and then hopefully , that no sugar is in there , which is the salt .
but also our perception itself , how psychological you are .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the little , although it doesn &apos;t matter , but they &apos;re just the same big , and yet our perception , depending on what context we do .
anybody knows what that is ?
honey on .
and the most important thing is , the way that was still supposed to work .
there &apos;s a lot more to my glasses there .
so it &apos;s the n circle .
a second circle starts to associate certain , or associate certain .
and if i &apos;m going to wait a little bit more , we don &apos;t see a unit , and we don &apos;t just see a unit , which is circle , circle and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle .
so , you &apos;re called a little bit of the way that you &apos;re going to be able to do that , and it &apos;s also influenced us in perception .
and for the gay , the most important thing that &apos;s most important in the first semester , the great most amazing .
and the end of the box near the continuity , and so on .
often , again , again , again , again .
but that &apos;s essential to the most important part , if you want to make things loud .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting is that it &apos;s .
sounds very accurate , but it &apos;s very exciting when you &apos;re busy busy .
so we have the eyes and now think of the eyes , we see from the front .
this is wrong .
you can see from back to the back .
because they &apos;re a assumption to the front that they see something they recognize , the circle of the circle .
that means we &apos;re just seeing our hand before we see it , and then we see that back to our own in our own system to say , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay
i &apos;ve got this cognitive design , you have what you want to see .
that &apos;s then there , that &apos;s coming back again .
then , again , it &apos;s going to the back because the back of the back is not and says , now , now , you know , now , you know , and you &apos;re going to be sure , if that &apos;s what you see , what you want to see .
and then it &apos;s going back to the back and then it &apos;s actually seen .
so a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , things that are happening for the things .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s familiar with you that picture .
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve described .
now , every one of this pattern is trying to see something .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
anybody &apos;s seeing something special ?
a more of the time , right .
if i saw that , that there &apos;s a kind of a computer in there , you know that .
they &apos;re never going to forget , because i &apos;m showing you where the most of the time is .
now you see the most of the time .
and on , now you see it .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve actually got to do now , you know , that they don &apos;t see any pattern , but i have a lot of time in a short time , and again , again , this dog in this joint picture is to see this a little bit .
and that &apos;s the projection of looking at the view of the view , and you see .
now i know it and now i &apos;m going to go to the front that i see the most of the time .
i see the most of the time .
so , very exciting processes that then , in this , , you know , gray is actually not , but here &apos;s the mass of this in the field of mass .
anybody knows what three seconds ?
long , yes .
this is our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know something three seconds , i &apos;m going to take a little bit of the present to the present , and i can also bridge very well , in which i &apos;m going to go through someone with three seconds .
it has to process it as a present .
then it goes into the past and so i can bridge very elegant to example , for example , if i know this phenomenon .
what does the most important milliseconds take milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
also , a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time you love in love .
that means that , if you know that , you &apos;re looking at who you look at as long as i &apos;m going to take a gun for what &apos;s going on , which is what can happen to be a loud thing .
and more aggressive milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time most of the perceptions we have .
that &apos;s what happens to this first impression in a fast fast speed , as we perceive things .
and how we see things that we &apos;re looking at and how we &apos;re also going to protect ourselves against our environment so that we can think about it .
of course , the creator don &apos;t only deal with the subject and neural , or neural , but primarily , of course , with the subject of the world &apos;s subject .
so how a human being is loud .
there &apos;s a lot of the practical functions that are the practical functions , so that &apos;s how the things that are so much more sophisticated or more .
there &apos;s a lot of the time i know where i have to get to the point of where i have to get .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why is someone for a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the time , where not what &apos;s going on , so , in the way , the money is not so practical ?
there are more than the symbolic , on the most devastating , which we &apos;re going to be in the world &apos;s favorite as a gay principle .
back to my actual topic of natural user interface and the theme , what &apos;s also also more important about , is a lot of the time .
and the way i can do is , as i can get a certain goal , i can get a certain goal , or how can a user in a certain particular world , efficient and a goal .
so it &apos;s more likely to say that .
how can i do something about this ?
i can do that directly or need to do it , and i need to be a &quot; n manual or i need to do training for this . &quot;
and less of the time or a more of the time , it &apos;s .
that i just make this different , and make beautiful , is not that it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and if you &apos;re part of the software that we &apos;ve seen , you &apos;re going to see , then you &apos;ll understand why 99 percent of our software is little intuitive or not useful , even though it &apos;s a lot more intuitive than classical software .
it &apos;s not just about apple &apos;s , and it &apos;s not just a fundamental thing for apple , and the fundamental thing is , if i want to make technological devices , the people want to be useful .
why ?
because in the rule we &apos;re in the way that we &apos;re in the new way of the world &apos;s way , so the natural user is five times faster in average .
you have to imagine that if you make something the classic of classical , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , only one hour .
that &apos;s not that you can probably go home , and you can go home , but you &apos;re going to fall to your employer or someone , and you &apos;re going to be busy in the way it &apos;s busy busy .
but i want to say that it &apos;s a kind of thing to do for us , and also a lot of things .
and then if we go back to the area of software , this is the first one of the first things that were very abstract , where you needed months to deal with these systems .
then the next thing that &apos;s going on now is to be the potential of the neural model or mental model as the software , which is , you know , you &apos;ve had a notion of something that &apos;s metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to make the metaphor .
so not more zeros and they are the code , and they &apos;re a metaphor .
this was a lot more of the time , but it &apos;s also much better .
the next generation of the brain &apos;s work is working very much more with behavior .
so i &apos;m going to make a lot more often more often the behavior as the behavior .
this is also a paradigm paradigm .
that i think that &apos;s always the way that i look at the success of success , just the most successful app .
and if i &apos;m going to step in the natural user , and then i &apos;m going to be a step of these natural subjects , where i &apos;m from voice , by language , by intent , by gesture and the things that have to control things , and i &apos;m still going to grow .
but that leads me to the point , when are things going to be , because the things are really intuitive ?
if you &apos;re going to be intuitive and then i have to get my little friend here , and look at what does that mean , because it &apos;s actually a little bit more intuitive ?
and that &apos;s a little bit more intuitive for us to think about it , if i think about it .
so he would like to think , it &apos;s not like to think , but it &apos;s just doing it .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive is it .
and what does that mean for designers ?
that means if we look at existing , we can transmit existing of a little bit of a different thing to , for example , the metaphor , i can use that as a creator .
that means i can just transmit a intuitive , human being on a software and make the software much more powerful .
and of course , the question is , what &apos;s actually the most important thing that &apos;s actually the most important thing about us and now i &apos;ve been telling you .
this is called the so-called the so-called the so-called .
this is what everybody &apos;s using , and it &apos;s a rockefeller and it &apos;s a bamboo and it &apos;s a close-up of the mode of the , and it &apos;s a lot of the way , the point of the way .
this is what everybody &apos;s doing , but it &apos;s the most devastating and it &apos;s kind of intuitive , and it &apos;s kind of kind of a kind of intuitive or part .
the model is already going to be a lot of the womb in the womb and is a lot of it , so it works in the world at young and old , and it &apos;s going to be used by the whole time that most of the things knew that this model is .
and the most , in the way , is about 50 to a half to a half times from us to the activity , so you &apos;ve found that it &apos;s less often going to be more often more often than the day .
i can now be able to be able to see this mental , and i can see this mental , and the point of the world is , in a sense of a car .
and through these kinds of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the world &apos;s metaphor , but not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a global object , a kind of a system .
and that &apos;s on a higher grail of the world &apos;s than the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the most of the most , the most of the most .
and if i &apos;m going to be able to get the way i was a lot of a sudden , for example , in the i &apos;m a lot of a sudden , as a choice , it &apos;s a choice , and it &apos;s going to be big to me , and i can see that , and i can go to the details , and i &apos;m going to go to someone , and i &apos;m going to go to someone , and i &apos;m going to go to someone .
then i can transmit the whole .
i &apos;m trying to do this by a point of view .
just have a cake .
so , i &apos;m going to use it now with the object , and i can zoom back to the object .
i &apos;ll be able to filter the entire thing , now , and you can tell me , just show me all of the thing with chocolate for example .
and once a interface , what &apos;s much more intuitive and very much natural .
because , because i can reach the things like the pieces , and you can come to me , is much natural than the other of the thylacines , or other mechanisms , can make these things available .
imagination is more likely to be more powerful , and with this sentence , i &apos;d like to close to this sentence , and i &apos;d like to close a , and also to give the evidence to be different , and in this sense , thank you very much for your attention and please .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first , if you &apos;re going to be a kid , as a child , is that they &apos;re going to take care of what the most of the things they have , yes , and depending on whether their parents have told them , more or less , and the more , more , is , of course , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
so , all of that , all of these are , and the curious ones are , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m now about this , basically , that whole whole thing , the most , 40 years , 40 years of life .
and there &apos;s a central point .
and that depends on phosphorus .
give a chance .
every day they give them a + scale , they have about two grams phosphorus , and every day they need to take two grams phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only be a commodity of the world &apos;s own .
if we did not take phosphorus and we &apos;re going to get .
amazingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re going to be here with something that &apos;s actually going to be a little bit of a time , but not that .
because all of the energy , but nobody talks about the most of the time .
the most critical thing is a lot critical .
we depend on two countries .
we just have phosphorus and now , and now , by the world &apos;s most much more uranium , it &apos;s brought up a lot more uranium in the environment than in all nuclear weapons .
in the last 20 years , the tons of uranium are distributed on our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we take .
it makes leukemia at children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , the environment , is getting less car .
the environment , make less waste .
the environment , the environment , less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
this is how if i would say , you &apos;ll be able to blow your child , beat it three times five times five times five times five times .
this is just a little less destruction .
if we think about the census of the problem to the most remote , our whole earth is used or later , or later , a cemetery .
so , that &apos;s what the problem is to think about .
and the most important thing about this is to look at the ground as a first .
in the ground , over 60 percent of the most remote .
now , we &apos;re building corn and lose corn between 11 and 30 kilograms of 30 tons per hectare , or on the square square .
that means we &apos;re losing about five times more than new , more than new educated .
we can see , of course , the most important thing .
and everything is a packaging or content .
for example , in the most remote , 20 percent of the most of the most remote of the most remote of the world &apos;s .
and because we &apos;re getting older , it will be bigger .
it &apos;s kind of all of the most , kind of all of the time .
yes ?
one baby needs about six hundred years .
we could reduce that for 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is going to be balanced in china in a second .
this is completely seemingly seemingly .
so the question is , how do we go to these workshops ?
here &apos;s one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be able to attract the pigs over the solid components .
in the people over the urine .
yes .
so , you can &apos;t be men .
because that &apos;s what &apos;s known with it , right ?
so , in general , we think of the most many in the world , we &apos;re too many on the world .
and if you &apos;re the people who are the people who are going to be the people who are going to be more , if you say , you &apos;re not there , you &apos;re not going to be there , and you &apos;re going to be inappropriate .
and so someone says , like al gore , one of our great heroes , there are nothing more than the human population .
in israel , you say , if you &apos;re a life , you &apos;re going to be the earth .
here it says , the more you &apos;re going to be the better .
yes .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then they weigh the ants about four more than we do .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , no one may be seen , and it &apos;s a lot of them , even though they &apos;re beaten .
that means the ants weigh much more than we .
and because they &apos;re physically working much harder than we and because they just live three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in the energy consumption , in the energy consumption .
that means we &apos;re not too much , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you &apos;re going to see how far we &apos;re going to get to what we really wanted to do and how sad we are , and how sad we are at all , you can see that for example , for example , a program , you know , is a program , yes ?
you can only be more likely if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
did you have seen a tree tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means we want to be significantly as trees , yes ?
yes ?
no tree is a tree .
luckily , yes ?
there &apos;s no more a more than trees .
there are still six billion trees still in the ganges .
so , you &apos;ve heard about it , you know , about a lot of the trees ?
that means all our intelligence means we want to be significantly as a trees .
and where you see , even like the periphery , the most remote biological , agriculture , is not that our own own .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really had to go back into the spears .
and so we &apos;re too many .
alone .
that &apos;s what we feel guilty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no more a , no more , no , no , no , a , and how they all allow the other to be the fact that our own fingertips are going back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , which oil oil spills .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it comes to the environment , the highest , not to be there , yes ?
and the way , yes , yes ?
you can only have a lot of the time , if you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot yourself now , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can go back to our nutrients .
we &apos;re doing agriculture in brazil in the way we get nutrients .
and we can do that in the way that we can do nutrients in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china for example , where we take the waste of it .
in china , a kind of a more of the time is a more of the time , sort of , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid , our nutrients .
that means that the western world is going to be made of that , that the city has only been able to get a little bit back , but the farmers never have a little bit back .
so , that &apos;s what cities had to grow more , because the farmers were going to go to cities and the cities always had to get their nutrients away .
so all western rich are always expanding until they didn &apos;t have the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re in the way .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done the civilization of a little bit of a hundred years , because you &apos;ve always been able to bring nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat in china , you expect to be able to stay on the food that you &apos;re going to stay on until you &apos;re going to go to the toilet .
because it &apos;s a benign , to go and take nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to eat them , not to the food .
that means you can see the internet , how to go back to the nutrients .
that &apos;s what &apos;s really nice to do when you do that , so agriculture makes it accessible , accessible to a hectare of land with five thousand people , and the plant is going to be able to grow and the powder and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish .
and the great thing about this is that the most powerful in the favelas around the favelas are going back to the 800 percent .
so we don &apos;t need to control people , and we &apos;re not going to be able to be a little bad .
we can support them , good to be good .
this is of course , of course , but the facilities are wearing themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by design , which is a farmer that can just manage them .
that means that the most little thing goes back .
and no one of these facilities , we &apos;ve built over the last 20 years , not that we &apos;ve been able to have a lot of these facilities .
they could just just be a liter of a liter of the brain and then they would be fooled by years .
don &apos;t find instead .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people , and it &apos;s a little bad to be a little bad .
we can support them , good to be good .
that means we need to have phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you &apos;re writing , in germany , the best thing is in the world &apos;s best .
unfortunately , not in the world , but maybe you can help the most little , you know , a little bit of the time .
because the most important facility could be the best the phosphorus .
and that has to go back .
we see that phosphorus really is critical .
and we see that it &apos;s really going to be done .
we &apos;ve been using a lot of years in holland now .
the dutch government has explained , they will be the first country in the world , which phosphorus is .
but we need this in total .
understand , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s world .
there &apos;s a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of the world &apos;s .
these are the countries that control 40 percent of the most remote .
and the oil is going to replace us through other energy cells .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace .
it &apos;s not about making the existing one slightly less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s mostly to ask what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , you understand that , of course , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine , if you &apos;re sad , you &apos;re sad when you were being adopted , and you get 50 to 50 .
completely inefficient .
but all of it , right ?
or take a pilgrimage .
a woman in germany eats about six kilograms of three kilograms of their life .
so .
this is not exactly not exactly correct because we don &apos;t know how much more of the things that are going to be done .
but a pilgrimage , even at that lighting , can tell you , is completely inefficient , but all of it , right ?
a whole thing in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask what &apos;s the right ?
not , the most little bit better to burn and it &apos;s a little bit better and to lose the whole materials for the germs , but first of all , how do you have to ask moisture ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i &apos;m going to dinner them , and i say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with a computer and a glass of water .
wonderful , &quot; right ?
this is efficient .
everything in life is beautiful , not efficient .
if you fall in love , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything in life is going to be the way that it &apos;s not to save , to avoid .
the whole thing .
we say the people , oh , you don &apos;t have green in the south .
no , the throw away is exactly the right , yes ?
in every place where you &apos;re going to get out of , you &apos;re doing it again .
but the wrong things .
if you &apos;re the wrong things , you have a more of the way .
in the way we think about north .
there &apos;s every footprint .
if you walk , yes , everybody &apos;s reduced the ground .
because the soil is going to die , and the wind and the wind and the water is moving away .
but if you &apos;re in italy , everyone means the footprint that the water remains longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that &apos;s going to be a haircut .
not a lot of it .
we say in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask them , how do you go to your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; well , yes ?
this is the minimum minimum .
so not saving , you get to avoid .
every waste is fixed .
and it &apos;s a wish if you see in italy , how people are going to be in the high bow , and they were staying in the car .
because you know , this is a kind of a process .
it &apos;s a form of the form of the world , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please beautiful .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a more of the way that it &apos;s a little bit of the fluid in temperature .
you can take it to the way you go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re building all over the place .
and she contains seeds from rare plants so they &apos;re going to do it through the norms .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so it &apos;s going to be two tickets .
not all of it should be , of course , the tar .
a television or a washing machine , you &apos;re just using it , they don &apos;t use it .
just the things that the most remote , like the most , like the , as a result , how to be the way that you have to be in biological systems .
things that are used only to be used in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the most of the time , yes ?
very direct ads , and it &apos;s not for the company of celebrity , but it &apos;s that they help this company to make these products successfully successfully .
because we don &apos;t do the things that we don &apos;t do .
yes ?
so , if i &apos;m going to eat them , and i say that &apos;s free from the most of the time , you can &apos;t help you .
no , we &apos;re stuck in what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like the most of the time .
not toxic in the place .
but everything , what is useful is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can put on the most remote of the world &apos;s most , and the rubber in biological toxins can go , yes ?
everything is about the tar of it .
and if it &apos;s going to be , of course , it &apos;s going to be for selective , for nike , for the most , and the whole industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the most of the most common things that causes through the textile industry .
so , you &apos;re helping you to ask you to ask people .
hey , israelis , do you really do serious ?
because the only thing that has been changed is that the most remote thing has changed .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really get a really of it .
so , help me a little bit of it .
but it &apos;s going .
yes .
that &apos;s what has been shown .
this is .
we can now do things that they &apos;re doing when they &apos;re cutting up , if they &apos;re cutting , they can be in biological habitats .
technical bonds are just as much .
there &apos;s a direct system of this .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , that &apos;s done for that , in the cycle .
and so , in every store , you can do things .
if you come on that , yes ?
do you remember the conditions ?
if it &apos;s the trash .
all over these halls are around , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there &apos;s also on the world &apos;s most , but even in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastics , that he can go into biological systems , if we change the most , inside , that they can just go back to a baby , and in tunisia , and in tunisia , trees are the plants .
yes ?
and if you take these conditions , they &apos;re going to take them , they &apos;re taking it , and they take the powder to plants .
so this is the baby &apos;s baby for all life , and it &apos;s already the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be a lot of the way we can be more .
it &apos;s kind of a kind of a time to print a car .
yes , kind of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can even reinvent everything else .
i started a institute .
now , there are many people working there with and they can all be involved .
there &apos;s extra a club that &apos;s going to be a club where everybody can get involved .
so not save more , they &apos;re going to avoid , they &apos;re not going to reduce , not a more powerful waste , but intelligent waste .
does it make the curious thing ?
thank you .
the work of the world &apos;s work .
music as language .
in the description of my talk , i wrote that i wrote as a computer , so i &apos;m going to understand as a computer , so in english , understanding .
and the word of the written notes are the written notes in the equivalent of the dictionary .
that you don &apos;t just have a word for word for word the text in a different language , but also the deeper sense of words and the more , so that it has to make a good translation of doing it .
and in the german to translate the english , it can require more knowledge , and it &apos;s going to require it if you go to poetry or anything about poetry .
but it &apos;s very alien for the spatial , which we do with our heritage .
as a result of a computer , i just first have the written notes .
you think that the composer in the notes have exactly everything that he has been aware of .
in fact , the notes are very vague and recycled .
these notes are about just as much as a verbal , and as a verbal , as a verbal , if it &apos;s very seemingly , a landscape of a landscape .
because in this auction , the smell of flowers are not smell to smell the degree of the flowers , the degree of the world &apos;s most too much to hear .
that means the the maltese , the most of the time , has to be the most powerful in a different , which is a different , concrete , collaborative , entrepreneurial , entrepreneurial .
today i want to tell you what i &apos;m doing , so , i &apos;m going to translate it to a verbal language , and then again , in a verbal language .
so basically a translation of translation .
so i &apos;m going to put it on german , because if i had to translate it back to the english , it would be a result of translation of translation .
so the music works for me so much as the spoken language .
the most the notes have the function of the letters of a script .
so it doesn &apos;t take to learn , just to learn grades and to get the keys on the piano or the right place on a car .
that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the sense of the letters you can see when you can do the language .
so , you need to do this for the learning of music at least as long as spoken language .
there &apos;s also a graphic , if you learn it for the most , only passive or you can talk to the musical speaker , until the musical speaker .
the work of the most , same thing begins like a computer system .
after you first chose a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re going to be able to be a fool of the emergence of the composition of the composition .
you &apos;re offering information about the piece of the piece of the piece .
you read in the letters , the notes , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts of composers itself .
you studied the works that he was writing before and after .
you &apos;re comparing .
the humpback ponds , writing it .
how did he feel it ?
how were his life conditions , how the society and politics ?
all of this is interested in me .
you think of this time by looking at contemporary images , or reading literature .
but you have a rich knowledge of time , but you have a rich knowledge to be the composers that you play more , and it falls more easier to feel in it .
the composer will always be more to the friend that you live with .
his cause to write the piece of the piece is always more and more to my personal cause , to play .
now , there &apos;s a very different record of the message of the composer , but only one framework , i &apos;m now going to turn this framework to the point , and meaning it to sense .
i &apos;m going to say with my own words , which could be written between this framework .
i play the way that these notes could have .
now for me , for the composers and what they could now mean for him today .
every tone , every phrase , is a sense of a sense because i feel it , because it &apos;s a lot of my time , because it &apos;s a lot of my favorite .
it has to be in here and now , and now , i can &apos;t convince my audience that this is my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert when i can have the experience that i &apos;ve been able to find out so long in the ahead of how new to experience .
as you &apos;ve been happy to have a happy new day , even though with the same rituals of life , breakfast , breakfast , to work , so that i &apos;m going to go back to the same piece .
i &apos;ve become older , the seasons change , my pulse is going down at night , in a auditorium , it takes longer that the sound back back to home .
i &apos;m going to breathe the audience true , or the unconscious .
all of that affects me and all of this affects my experience with the composition .
so , wonderful , if i stand with a computer , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , more , more , more , more .
you get a new idea in and a way to get this answer with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting because then things that we haven &apos;t dreamed of , and what you can &apos;t do is not be a samples .
it makes great fun to make music , and they have the audience , and they &apos;ve experienced how the music communicates alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more like this , like this moment .
i can &apos;t play today as in 20 years .
and i &apos;m going to have more life life than today , and that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to have a lot more of the time in the field of the world &apos;s own , and emotions and emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some of the most little things that have been more likely to do , but for this new competition .
have a nice physical example of this .
it was on a computer of the day for a long old teacher , professor , professor , a famous , known , a famous , famous , and a professor of the most professor here in the world &apos;s .
unfortunately , i was too young , so he was a lot of the time that he was going to study .
but i had the great luck , it was very early , with 13 years , and i was in my school for a school .
i was 17 , when i went back to his classes , and i played the last one of the four bond of chopin , a computer .
he asked me what the introduction of this kind of thing was for me .
this is a kind of a part of a part .
and in my favorite , i said , expectation .
and he &apos;s got it and he said , so ?
that has to be the most important thing .
because for me , she &apos;s memory .
he was over 60 .
well , with 17 , you just have dreams , but not a significant memories .
i play the piece of all the few years , and it &apos;s always been done for me , although not a single note has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because again i read something new .
one example of a very different area .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different school row , in the light of light .
he &apos;s translated the most , translated up , like he saw them , like they &apos;re in this moment .
his personal life of the most of the time .
the interpretation of a piece of a piece is that this is comparable .
now i &apos;m also older than chopin with a little bit of years when he wrote the piece .
he was just living for a long time .
and it &apos;s important to me , again , to look at the notes , even though i mean , you can do it .
to keep the way to keep the composers , right with composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially if he died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said , you need to have about the spoken language for the spoken language .
often the most , the way that you &apos;re doing that is that you learn the notes .
you &apos;re learning that first , before you just talk a word .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
if all the fingers and right , as it is in the notes , they come out , then sound comes out of the way music sounds like music .
if that &apos;s happening , the students get the most profound piece .
about interpretation is hardly talking about the interpretation .
well , there &apos;s a very good thing , and then it &apos;s a quick piece .
and the most slow , slowly .
and according to the most , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s what most of you here .
but even if you &apos;re doing this data , it &apos;s still something technical .
and yet it &apos;s not a interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something very much about it .
because , to make music on the instrument , the own musical , and you should be there before .
because the sing .
a child that &apos;s not learned that the sing is not going to have the parents , it &apos;s not going to be done by itself .
this is like the most remote .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music to get it over a more way , so that &apos;s a instrument to sound .
people who never sing , have never felt immediately with their body , like it &apos;s , to form a sound .
a phrase with his own breath .
the process is the extension of our body .
our vocal vocal to sing our hands and feet to dance .
so the chief is the sequel of my finger .
the tune comes from the most of the time and the rhythm from the dance .
the saddest of the world today is not a fool .
you don &apos;t need to do music , if it &apos;s going to be boring .
not more needed to whistle a , or singing .
every single music is going to be hacked when you &apos;re constantly going to get out of music .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t sing ?
so , the question i can &apos;t sing , can &apos;t sing a , because you believe that they can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because you don &apos;t have learned to sing ?
in both of the way , it &apos;s not too late to find out whether they can &apos;t do it , or to learn how to do these little muscles that are going to put the vocal vocal , right .
so that can train .
or c , because you have them to get them out of them .
so , what am i asking , how do you have a spear ?
did you have a more of the time or a more of the time , how do you say it today ?
or d , they don &apos;t like to wait for music and want to do it also .
but what i &apos;d like to do is , because music is a beautiful , a beautiful thing .
but maybe you can also even get it more .
well , you see , all of the cases has to be a little bit of a candidate candidate .
but say , &quot; don &apos;t i understand anything about classical music . &quot;
i can &apos;t say if it &apos;s good or bad .
and i said , &quot; well , i can say , &quot; well , you can say , &quot; or not . &quot;
because i don &apos;t think it says , i don &apos;t know if it tastes me because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t get to eat , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to get to classical music , because they don &apos;t play a instrument .
listen to , and say , if it tastes you or not .
whether the music is to get them to too sweet .
tell that what you feel .
and they also get more sophisticated and they want to be a little more spongy there , or taste , even fine differences .
why am i suggesting now from my audience that it &apos;s also active ?
because the music is a language , and a language is to communicate .
a artwork that you never look at is not a force .
the food , that &apos;s from a chef or a chef , has been eaten , and not just looked at the contracts or the recipes .
so you &apos;re listening to , if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice kind of a nice piece .
if in a environment where adults are active , or at least , the adult music is going to hear music , a child , then it &apos;s very easy to ask , to ask the color of your flower ?
can you now play them in blue ?
and the child plays , after a , a red flower , a blue flower .
and this sounds very different than before .
this was the first beginning of a single musical expression .
so the first step to a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece of play today , which is originally written by a hundred , 400 years ago ?
now , the instruments have moved .
there was no piano in the river than a tool .
it was not invented yet .
i think the stream would have been excited when he had the indigenous possibilities of the modern world .
i can now get the most of the time that the stream had been able to sound on the modern wing , which is not able to make a sense of a computer .
and also , from beethoven , you know that he heard more than he was deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which is a orchestra of the time .
so the composers are dependent on us , which are the pieces of the pieces that are going to be able to reinvent .
so they &apos;re going to be a mess of what they &apos;re going to have to be held in the spirit .
and also , what you would think about today is .
or that , what i &apos;m going to do today because what you might have thought of .
thank you .
you know what scratch is ?
were they already a robotic headquarters ?
and how did that feel ?
downloaded .
i have a friend who goes a little bit .
if i come , with my little divergence , i &apos;m going to get a little bit of the way that i &apos;m going to get this feeling .
i &apos;m going to take something through the head .
i say , &quot; do you need the n of the n ? &quot;
it &apos;s a lot of the time that half of his value is half the value .
and at all , you work much less than i .
why do i have to afford to do this n little car ?
and then i immediately falls to this , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this awkward feeling is gone .
our organism has invented a great way to get these kinds of things like scratch .
you can also try that with words like revenge or a book or a book company .
i want to tell you about this mechanism today , or something to do , or something you &apos;re likely to do .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but think about it not the lie , like you may have heard of it if people say , no one has a wall .
and then rocks , so he &apos;s going to get to the view of the view .
and in such a lie , you see that the liars don &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to check out that it &apos;s been very different in sense of mind .
it &apos;s just a matter of it , and it &apos;s not itself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about is to do that , you can deceive yourself .
they need this lie to get a kind of a , to get a self-deception upright .
you can get less easy , yes , and also bring it to the switch .
they need time .
from this time , a anecdote that you might know .
the spanish painter &apos;s a woman has once a woman &apos;s wife .
and this woman has been able to do that , and the portrait would not see her .
picasso says , wait only .
it &apos;s always going to be similar .
and in this place , if you laugh , you realize how important this lie is and how much time you need to learn what artists are very good to tell us .
because artists have a high ratio to lie .
the artist is giving you something with you , and especially this lady , what you don &apos;t see when you just look at the mirror .
the artist is going to share with you in such a portrait with what you &apos;re going to be familiar with when you look at this piece of artwork .
then this awkward feeling disappears , it could not be similar to you , and it &apos;s going to be similar to them .
here they have this mechanism that we can use as a great invention to the lie of our favorite .
and not only in art , in the southern world , in the mythology , in the mythology , it &apos;s going back to the .
you may know that idea of the lady , which is every morning in the mirror , and he asked who is the most beautiful in the country ?
one day this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a kind of a computer .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you know how much hostility from this true embrace , also , can &apos;t lie out of this true contribution .
but we should just make us familiar with that , that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a little bit of a different one .
here &apos;s it necessary , which we understand under the world &apos;s own , again .
we need this lie that we need to be the myth that we can &apos;t get to the deception without that .
we don &apos;t just have the art in the art of the world , but in the science , it &apos;s also great lying .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s wife from the woman &apos;s wife .
she heard about this book from charles darwin , the emergence of the species and the punchline of people .
that the human being should be the monkeys , and yes , it was a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then they ran them to her husband and said that , it &apos;s not true , which is charles writing .
the human being should have a lot of the monkeys or a common ancestor .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , we need to prevent that people know about it .
why do we prevent that people know about something if it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live without these kinds of things .
because we &apos;re that self-deception , this feeling , great to be , the highest creature , not by one such kind of a kind of a particle , from something like a organism that exists in the way that it exists .
so , we can &apos;t even have these things .
we need to prevent that people know from things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so , you see , how slow this mechanism is going to go down and how the traces look like the traces that he &apos;s going to go to something else than that great picture of ourselves , i want to give you another story .
a particularly nice story , like i mean .
my wife told me .
she came from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told her from a student .
a student student .
it likes to be particularly like it , because he &apos;s a tendency to the granny .
and she asked him what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire .
and because i &apos;m at the fire , i &apos;m interested in the fire of the things .
yes , you &apos;re feeling it , if you &apos;re drawn to this place , there &apos;s something wrong .
i said , i said , &quot; i &apos;ve been told , &quot; a human being , &quot; because of a human being , we should try and replace it through the most remote , although it &apos;s to replace it .
do it once and then you experience the sentence .
although i &apos;m in the fire , i &apos;m interested in the fire of the things .
they feel that it &apos;s the real truth behind the landing .
so a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it , but it &apos;s not a little bit of the time .
and the interest is for the most important .
but there &apos;s no clubs that we can look at , where you &apos;re learning , how to do fire .
there &apos;s only the second second , just the fire .
it &apos;s been signed up .
and the most , you don &apos;t say your teacher , you don &apos;t like to put fire somewhere , and you &apos;re happy to put it on the fire , if the fire comes out of the road .
no , it just looks much better when we show that we &apos;re going to be able to get the dangers of the other , the other if you put fire .
here they have this little mechanism .
this is the most little thing that the most remote thing that was in the heart of the world &apos;s own , that he &apos;s actually related to fire , but that he can &apos;t tell that .
here they have this kind of thing between the unconscious and the conscious , which immediately goes down , without that they can do something about it , and the things that you know is that they can look very much better for them and others can be able to look at it .
so , just like this , these words that we &apos;re going to use in the language of political persuasion .
we actually know that something else is .
but we know if we &apos;re going to say that , the social is very sensitive to the social .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to do things in a society that should work .
so i want to argue what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
after which logic , these self-deception , the willingness , the willingness to be a different reality than that , from the fact that we &apos;re actually in the unconscious , is to spread out to the outside .
so , i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is , what many of you know , and some of you estimate , very few , just not need .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is something intellectual , says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not stop by stop , physical nature .
and if you have people who are the solid belief , they have a soul , or you can also say that they have been able to be able to be able to be able to be the soul that &apos;s like this , and they &apos;re not just like the soul , and they &apos;re not just like a mental framework , not matter , and they &apos;re not just like the soul .
and from this soul , you think that they somehow think of nature in this world , in this particular sense , in the latin of the latin , the most , present , present .
and if this is the most important thing about people , it &apos;s filled with the mind with nature , with nature , which can only live life , yes .
and then he can just be a little bit of the time .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so she &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we should be able to perceive them as something that &apos;s going to be true for our lives .
and if you have this premise , you understand the logic that we &apos;re experiencing this happiness , through a lie of our world .
because now you can apply a more of the time .
you know , you know , you know , you know , the school .
this is a kind of a computer that describes us a logic .
this is the hardest part of my talk .
here you need something logic , but also the willingness to lie .
so , lying that they can just apply that logic wrong .
in this particular , three sentences come .
the first sentence is , the first sentence , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if you have a right , it &apos;s not a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i &apos;ve been in particular .
a third sentence that &apos;s immediately going to come up with people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
and they say who doesn &apos;t have soul , that &apos;s dead and not saying anything .
and here you feel .
here &apos;s what this logic comes in in this , yes , in this particular talk .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences that are logical .
i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a talk about reality .
i can say the most of the time is a man .
and if i &apos;ve been right , the most is a man .
if i don &apos;t have right , the most is the most man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s true .
i can claim everything .
but critical is , if i &apos;ve been right , it &apos;s just true .
so if you say , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he didn &apos;t have soul .
these things are logical correct .
and now our most , conscious consciousness , is immediately able to do something .
it &apos;s a third sentence , which doesn &apos;t have anything to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s how the opposite of the first sentence is proven and traditionally .
because actually we have to prove whether there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that just uses that two sentences are comfortable , and a third of the world &apos;s , which looks like he would have something to do with that , so we can save our own .
so , we &apos;re doing that as if it &apos;s impossible to be able to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can keep these things on different examples .
in the present , we have a very modern example of the world that &apos;s always going to be the most modern .
so , you have to have another philosophical topic , a more philosophical issue , a lot of the philosophy .
that &apos;s what we do to do that we go back into the world &apos;s century .
there was a scholars that was called the jet , and after that , the most of the most unhealthy marx named the most of the sudden .
the most of the most unhealthy annual , a declining , which is from pure nature .
that &apos;s not the soul .
this is a kind of a kind of a kind of a .
and if you put the right in the middle between two of the things in the middle of two .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to do first .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
so the most , the most , introduced .
and the forces with the brain system is solving each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening .
just if you get another example , so if you &apos;re immediately making a haystack , it doesn &apos;t need any reason , and it doesn &apos;t need any reason to do it .
automatically he &apos;s going to go to the right thought .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in nature , and it &apos;s going to be driven by the larger pile , which is a immediately , and then they have a little bit of the feeling that it has to be like a free will .
and if we &apos;re in the world &apos;s most , i remember the most remote thing for brain science .
there &apos;s a scholars that means wolf , and it says , sometimes , wolf , you &apos;re not going to say , there &apos;s no free .
now we can make the second sentence , and we can say , if wolf has right , it doesn &apos;t have a free machine .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can do is read almost every day in the newspaper , you find that in this third sentence .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s about who doesn &apos;t have free , it can &apos;t be moved to his actions , and they &apos;re moved to responsibility and they &apos;re going to be a lot of the things that are going on .
there are also again .
and you have to prove that it &apos;s going to be a little bit like that .
but the logic of deception allows us to do that as if the first sentence of the first sentence is wrong than you have to take the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just do anything if you want to do anything if you want to test anything , and if you want to test anything , if you want to make people happy , this courage to practice .
so , you practice that , if you &apos;re going to meet a human being , you can say , there &apos;s no more a way of saying .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for the most of the time , which means the prophet .
it &apos;s not allowed to call it a little politically more politically .
tell , there &apos;s no more a more .
immediately , you &apos;re going to be a , for granted , and you &apos;re going to experience that , you can &apos;t prove .
and you have a problem .
because as they &apos;re busy , they &apos;re not able to prove that they can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no more than a lot of the man .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s got them fooled .
because he led them to a $ broad , and he doesn &apos;t even get it down .
because actually , this person is not interested in evidence .
it &apos;s just interested in it , and it &apos;s just to prove to yourself that there &apos;s a lot of time to be able to be .
so , in the way , in the way , you &apos;re experiencing the lucifer of the lie .
and if you have a way to feel this kind of thing , this is the way that you have to feel that , in other people , they &apos;re going to do it , because they &apos;re going to be happy to remember that way .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good day .
i told myself i &apos;ve asked you if i could mention them .
it &apos;s one of the most amazing at this great event , and i asked if i was going to think of this talk , and my idea of the other ridge .
i have to say , you have a lot of it , and i fell in the beginning of my idea .
and i may be able to introduce my favorite to you , i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but it &apos;s of course the sum of the amount of ideas .
i probably think , you know , the two nice girls , i probably &apos;m going to be a little bit of the generation that &apos;s made for this bad image of the image , because i &apos;ve started studying engineering , technical school , and i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , put it .
and i &apos;ve got it in the middle of the 1980s , because i wanted to make renewable energy and that was not in the middle of the world .
there was the most popular thing .
the ones in the back then , the most popular thing was called the most , the most popular .
the hot today .
because a good engineer has built either great cars or a lot of the cars .
but this is what the n of the n of the world is out of the square square of the square square , which was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy thing .
i &apos;m grateful that he &apos;s got the word again , because after the most , you didn &apos;t use the word anymore because everything was left , because everything was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that in the world &apos;s years .
there was just that there was a lot of the time that there was a lot of the time that was in the world &apos;s own , and one of them was in the most remote in the world &apos;s .
the place of the world &apos;s place , but that was called the wind and has a wind and solar energy and i started the middle of the 1980s .
and yes , a lot of what was told today , i &apos;m touched , because many , many beautiful expressions of expressions that i &apos;ve also lived in .
i worked in the collective , which was a lot of the collective .
we were 20 people .
if one said , the most , it was the most , the most , that has a completely more of a very , very much , i &apos;ve been doing it for 10 years , if i was my great favorite , i &apos;ve got a little bit of the money in your father .
it &apos;s busy with bulgaria .
and that was really , very , very , very , very , very , very , a picture in the way that i asked myself to get a thousand years , a thousand , thousands of years ago , the most amazing thing that was really like .
and i then have a way to get a lot of the time and then we have been with friends , i &apos;ve become a company who then has become a company who &apos;s got together with the most popular of the world .
and a , and we have a little bit of the problem , and we have the problem of a growing company , and we have a little group of a group , and we decided that we &apos;re starting to start with the next thing and the next topic of the future , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
and i brought you a project that i want to introduce you to now .
and the title of the talk was , yes , as you get to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started asking a relatively broad story , where could you have a memory of a sense of mind today .
on this island , that &apos;s the island of the island .
yes , these are the data .
there &apos;s four thousand people .
and that &apos;s a renewables today of 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
it &apos;s just technological .
if you get more wind , the system starts to fail .
i always tell the politicians , when they &apos;re in the world &apos;s facility , and they &apos;re going to be in the animal .
and then , the say , why ?
we &apos;ve already got 20 percent in germany .
but not a problem .
but not , we have seven percent , and our net is physically seen the european .
if we had 20 percent , we had the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was just , the first time that was the first contacts , the first contacts , but just just started through the island .
as big as it was , because it &apos;s actually a battery that you have to be so a island so that you &apos;re going to be a island in 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 percent renewable .
and yes , i &apos;ll go back to a slide .
the conventional system looks like this .
by the way , a year is about a hundred years of electrical performance on the world .
that &apos;s the performance of a hundred nuclear power , because that &apos;s particularly fast everywhere .
the world &apos;s world &apos;s world , which is going to happen with the process , because you don &apos;t need permission .
this is fast .
you &apos;re going to go to this box .
and then it looks like this .
in the run , three of the most of the most remote ones are going to be waiting for two .
yeah , this is the load down there .
we also have a very precise data .
and the most , the solar system or whatever it is , is a system of the rule , or a system , which is just in small quantities of this .
our goal was just to say , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay .
the end of the world &apos;s going to be the wind and the wind , sun , the burden that you can map the bigger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the performance , you have to turn off the end .
that means that the moment you have to worry about that is that renewables can take the entire web .
and you can only do that if you &apos;re going to be able to get in any kind of way .
this is what nobody did on the world .
that &apos;s the little style , so you can also use your own car &apos;s car over a small car .
people always ask me what &apos;s going on to the most , because in the world &apos;s way , in the world ?
this is already .
but if you want to do multiple of these types of these types of these types , and you should build a net , it will be very complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to come to 70 to 90 percent renewable , and then there &apos;s this rest of the rest of this , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , that will be very , very expensive , and that &apos;s not going to work .
that &apos;s going to be a fire fuel , which then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , or caroline , that will be .
you have to go to a more of a sudden and not just the way that you &apos;re doing it , and not only the way it &apos;s going to be .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s going on , because with a normal , a little bit of a sudden , a battery .
how far is you going to get there ?
and then , a whole lot of simulation .
and have wind and sun and the burden and the load and came to the outcome , a very exciting result that you have to have a total system to be a middle of 50 cents per gallon , about 50 cents a gallon .
these were the first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay , okay , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we are cheaper as the most remote , when the most remote five percent per year goes up .
and then we started to negotiate with the most remote .
what do all of you have to do ?
have investors negotiate , i &apos;ve looked at new kinds of things .
we were just five people at the time to build a society again .
and again , again , the representation .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system also has a more of the time that we &apos;re doing 20 percent with the other , and also a more of the other things that don &apos;t have to be more than the other things .
and the most , the most the most , the most important thing that the most important thing that we do is we find that , we &apos;re very great .
we want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , which we &apos;re kind of able to map the electric of the island in the spectrum of one three very precisely .
that means we &apos;ve got to look at the largest battery of the world .
here she is .
that &apos;s where asia is coming from asia , in the case of japan .
and it &apos;s a nonprofit in the &apos; 70s , and it &apos;s been a bbc in the &apos; 70s , and then , in the &apos; 70s , and then it became a japanese .
it &apos;s you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
she has a megawatts of performance and can bring six hours for this performance and that &apos;s the battery that we have kind of a little bit of the battery .
and then they put them .
we also have one of these a little bit of the same size , as he says there , in the hall , to actually put the complete dynamic behavior of this web , so it &apos;s the way that the next is , here &apos;s the whole battery , here &apos;s the whole battery , and here &apos;s the whole battery , here &apos;s the whole battery , which is the whole battery , and here &apos;s the whole battery .
here we are the whole thing that we &apos;re going to simulate the whole thing that the cable &apos;s most , to the cable , to represent the net in the net .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we can also get away storms of the web .
here we see this again , we see the entire one , here again , the whole one , individual .
and what we did since the most of the time was the hall , then , until today , everything is going to be done between the individual system in electronics , and we &apos;ve done it .
so we &apos;re not a more of the time , but we define as a company that &apos;s only between the subject and the subject and everything between it .
you have to communicate of the battery , and you have to communicate in the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is that you can basically take all the most , in the island of the island , that we will get to problems that we will get to be able to increase our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion , as it &apos;s going back , is going back and the most , and the way that we should go to the island is , for example , for example , for example , for example , we &apos;re going to have the wind and the sun .
and then , the most important thing is , then , the way it &apos;s going to be .
so , a lot of a sudden , a computer everywhere .
we can start to integrate the island of the island , to integrate , and you can do it , because you can manage the burden .
that means if you &apos;re in 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can &apos;t get through the n , you can do through the fish of nets , yes , that should be , you know , the percentage of the world , but you can never get to memory .
and that &apos;s the &quot; n little &quot; the message .
so , many people come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn the process down , you don &apos;t have this kind of grape , that causes a certain inertia in the net .
and our most , in fact , is just defined by louder masses of big power , where the wave is always all around europe .
we look at this web , see the 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s going to be nine hertz , we &apos;ll start a few of the most little things , then we &apos;ll come back to a little bit of a little bit .
this is the system .
and of course , this is incredibly formal .
if you &apos;re doing this somewhere , it takes it for a while .
the main reserve has at least 10 seconds to keep the web stable .
and in time , you can react to other people .
if you don &apos;t have that anymore , these transactions , they have to replace this with the most remote and the more , they replace it .
and we can even have a big battery to be two milliseconds .
and then you see what enormous of the enormous things are there .
and the message is , we need to get to this rotating masses , if we kind of do our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 30 percent and so on , if we want to get the most , if we &apos;re going to get to all of that , if we want to get the thing at all , if we want to get the thing .
then we have to break our capacity into the net .
and the power is simply called the power power , to keep the frequency .
yes , this is a very a kind of a moment , and it &apos;s a moment of the most , and we don &apos;t have any , or the way that we don &apos;t do it .
and we just try to get the capacity to make the capacity , the way that you can also get memory to the web .
so , there &apos;s also a lot of studies now .
and to this purpose , people are always coming and look at our own favorite , basically our most , sort of our favorite .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you get a piece of future .
and many discussions that i had in the last six years was similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years .
it &apos;s not , it &apos;s a bonus , and we &apos;re going to get all of them to do it .
we have 30 years of blobs today in germany .
this is a lot of the time .
and i just go from that , that we &apos;re going to store the same capacity in the next 30 years .
just just , it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s a whole lot of a lot of a lot of the most of the things that are going to be .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve been able to have seen the last two years that scientists are going to imagine my side .
we have now got over 10 million years of the world &apos;s disease , too , to the german net .
this is going to be in the next april .
so , you know , you see there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s just from this entrepreneurial pad to the idea , a hundred percent renewable .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a system of a system .
so far , in discussions , in discussions , this is trying to be trying to do this , that &apos;s going to be a little bit of the way that we have a little bit of the net that has nothing to do with our own .
the question is , but it &apos;s just if you &apos;re completely independent from some fossil or a half of the fossil or a half of them , and they &apos;re going to be a island .
then they just use what the sun and wind is there , where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a solar energy , and i &apos;m grateful , that they said , solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and the talk of the world &apos;s talk is that you can be a collective and solar energy , here &apos;s a little bit together .
and yeah , i want to encourage you to encourage you to be quiet in the sense that you can be quiet and also a vision .
and you really have to stay quite tough , but i think it &apos;s going to be .
thank you .
as steve , the way that steve &apos;s , the day , the los angeles times went through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a portable , a devastating , rough , homeless , who played on a violin that was only two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from the other article , it was a book that was a book that was a book that was going to be a book , robert , junior , and jamie , who was going to run the most promising career .
nathaniel left , and they suffered a breakdown , and 30 years later , he lived as homeless in the streets of the middle angeles of los angeles .
i recommend to read all of the , and i &apos;m going to see the film , and you can &apos;t see the film so that they don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness between these two men , but also , how the music helped this connection , and how did this developer make it happen , and how did this developer do , and how did this developer do , and how did this developer do , and how did this developer do , and then , when it was , the way that the gap is allowed
i met mr. &apos;s favorite in 2008 , two years ago , in the holocaust disney hall .
he just heard a demo of beethoven first and fourth symphony and came behind the stage to imagine .
he was talking to a very more , very much , and he &apos;s a very high clay on yo-yo &apos;s sound and hillary clinton and hillary clinton and how the dodgers would never create it in the baseball of the world &apos;s last violin .
we came to talk to music , and a few days later , i got an email , in which nathaniel was interested in me .
i have to mention that nathaniel is a medical treatment , because he was already with electric electric and with the oil and it &apos;s been treated , a trauma that has been tracking it all .
and as a result , it &apos;s particularly vulnerable to this schizophrenic stages , and these are sometimes bad , and he disappears , in the streets of the row of the row , and the computer of his own mind .
and in exactly a way , nathaniel was , when we started with our first class in the drake disney hall , he had this crazy thing in his eyes and he was completely lost .
he talked about invisible most of the , and smoke and smoke , like someone in sleep .
i was afraid , not a lot of the , but i was afraid i could lose him , that he could be able to break in his condition and i could destroy him to the violin , when i started talking about scale and other exciting forms of the world &apos;s most exciting form .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s .
and while i played , i fell on that in a complete change , a complete change .
it was when he was under the impact of a invisible drug , a chemical response , which was my game .
and the most of the time of anger is turned out to be in understanding , in a calm curiosity and grace .
and as a miracle , he took his violin and started playing some clips of a little bit of clips and then asked me to play , and then , to play , the most , more , a , more , more , more , more , more , a lot .
we started talking about music , started by bach , and they were laughing by beethoven , and they were , in the other hand , and all the other things , from the most , to the other of the other things .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just know a little bit about music , but it was a close personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i just know from my colleagues in the auditorium of los angeles .
by talking about music , and he was talking about music , was confused by this kind of thing , confused man , who was just moved through the streets of los angeles , a kind of a , a little bit , in malaysia , in malaysia .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means emotional health .
because the music allows him to see his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in something real .
and so he &apos;s going to be his host of the state of the state .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
this is why we do music : so we &apos;re doing something that &apos;s in all of us , deep in the inner , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity .
and the reality of this expression is all achieved , and it &apos;s moving , inspired us and together .
what nathaniel set up , so it brought the music back into a community of friends .
the power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood his talent and it was the data .
and i &apos;m going to go back with nathaniel music , whether in the holocaust disney hall , or in a row , because he reminds me why i became musicians .
thank you .
bruno &apos;s : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i &apos;ve stolen the most , the most i have stolen .
i hope you forgive me .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first one that was more like a passionate thing .
it was a beautiful fish , and it was a nice fish , good texture , a book on the foreground .
what a fish .
even better , he was being fed in the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel that it &apos;s going to be selling him .
i had a relationship with this beauty of a few months .
one day , the boss called the company , and i asked if i could give you a grade on the farm of the farm .
&quot; of course , i said . &quot;
here was a company that tried to solve what this unimaginable problem has become for our devastation . how do we keep fish on our own ?
in the last 50 years , we have the oceans like we &apos;ve beaten forests .
it &apos;s hard to get the destruction of the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas that are the most , the most , the most , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , maybe or bad , it &apos;s going to be a part of our future .
many arguments about it . the environment , the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a more of 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of the brain is necessary to get a pound to you .
not very sustainable .
not very good .
so here was a company that was trying to make it right .
i wanted to give them .
the day , i called the boss of the producer for the company .
let &apos;s do it .
&quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for that , so far outside in the sea that you don &apos;t get rid of the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out that waste is distributed from our fish , not focused on . &quot;
and then he added it , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this is the kind of a little bit of a bit of a , he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
so , a little bit of a little bit .
&quot; so &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
and at that night , i was in bed , and i thought , what about hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , shortly before the event , don &apos;t do .
i said , &quot; do you do what &apos;s sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to be wondering .
now , i &apos;m going to be a few people in the company . nobody could give me a sample of a sample of the senior biologists .
let &apos;s also do it .
&quot; do i say , &quot; what for example , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some of the most remote , and then he said , &quot; he said , &quot; he &apos;s .
i said , &quot; do you say , &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , the open , slow , dry and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of the world &apos;s . &quot;
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , these are about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; do you do what &apos;s sustainable about feeding chicken on fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i &apos;m going to be a fish of this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a computer of a computer and the most remote .
i &apos;m even .
no , i actually have a computer of this fish , because , i swear to god , who tasted fish after this conversation .
this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love .
it &apos;s the romantic way that you &apos;re learning , the better you learn to be able to know your fish , you love the fish more .
i &apos;ve eaten him first in a restaurant in a restaurant .
a journalist was talking for a long time for a long time .
it &apos;s got us a lot of a lot of time .
he came on the table with a bright , almost a little white color .
the chef had him a little bit of him .
wait twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can let a fish taste so good after he was a lot of the time ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it the humanities . actually , he &apos;s called the temes .
and no , he didn &apos;t pay the fish and he &apos;s not a chef . at least the way that you understand and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at the la la .
this is a kind of a little bit of the corner in the middle of the corner .
it &apos;s close to the mouth of the river .
until in the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of the computer .
they grew up in the way that basically were wetlands .
they did that by doing the country .
they built this complicated consequence of channels , and they &apos;re going to be able to be out of water from the country and out in the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that that worked , not economically .
and it was a disaster .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds to what are many birds .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company bought green the country .
what did you do ?
they have the flow of water street .
they literally have the lever .
instead of the water , they used the channels to get the water back to the water .
they &apos;re going to be the channels .
they created an 11,000 acres of the -- the most , more , shrimp , shrimp , shrimp -- and they have the humanities and his company that completely opposite the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
they stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see are the channels of the channels and the density , lush march .
i didn &apos;t have a long time ago with the humanities .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part of &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? there were we and fought through the wetlands and i was going to get a lot of the wetlands and i have a lot of the wetlands , and the humanities is holding up to my knees , and the temes is quiet in quiet a more .
here he picks up a rare of a rare .
now he mentioned the most of the time of the suburbs .
and here he looks a pattern of focusing on the top of the giraffe .
it turns out that the humanities are spent the largest part of his career in africa .
i asked him how he became a kind of a computer .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and falls in more talk of rare birds and algae and odd .
and you don &apos;t understand me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the most intriguing community , so in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way
it &apos;s great , but i was in love with it .
and my head became weak about this kind of piece of a piece of delicious fish that i had on the most remote .
so i was interrupted . i said , &quot; temes , how does it get that your fish tastes so well ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know young , the algae , the protests , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what eat your fish ?
how is the most important thing ? &quot;
now , he goes to me to tell me that it &apos;s a rich system that the fish eat , what they would eat in the wild .
the manufacturers , the bluefin , the suburbs , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely a lot of the time .
there &apos;s no food .
the one farm is heard that your animals don &apos;t melt ?
later , i went around the site with the arctic , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems like , &quot; how do you measure , &quot; how do you measure ? &quot;
in the moment , it was when a director had a director of a director .
and we &apos;re dreaming to the corner and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of thousands of thousands of , a literally , a , literally , to weigh carpet so far .
&quot; this is success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your own favorite , pink .
they &apos;re going to be . &quot;
and i was totally confused ?
i said , &quot; queerer , &quot; don &apos;t you get your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , he said . &quot;
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and the birds .
now last year , at this site 600,000 birds , more than 250 different types of species .
it &apos;s become the largest and one of the most important private systems in europe .
i said , &quot; queerer , is a good thing to do , the last one you want to have on a computer system ? &quot;
he was screaming his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building a lot of the time , not hard .
this is a environmental network .
the most the shrimp eat shrimp .
the shrimp eat the suburbs .
so the rescue the belly the better system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that doesn &apos;t melt your animals and a farm that &apos;s measuring your success on health of their predators .
a more of the time , but also a more of the time .
oh , and by the way , these are not even the most important ones that are there .
they breed in a city 240 miles , where the most important thing is better for the most remote .
every morning they fly 240 miles to farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles back .
they &apos;re doing that because they can follow the white white line of the highway .
seriously .
i had introduced a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at the humanities .
i said , &quot; queerer , fly 240 miles to the farm and then fly 240 miles back at the night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me when i was just quoted a song from whitney thanksgiving .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like a little bit of a time . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this kind of thing that &apos;s going on , the taste of the taste .
i never never cook with it .
and yet , when i tried to get them in the restaurant , she didn &apos;t recommend at all .
she liked sweet and in , when you take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned the humanities and he &apos;s going to be a lot of the time .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a swam .
it &apos;s the last defense , before something in the body .
she has developed the evolution of evolution to make a difference . &quot;
and then he added it , &quot; but our water has no more than a . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t melt your fish . a farm , which is measuring your success to success .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a hot , he &apos;s got enormous , because the water is coming through this farm from the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things to the things that are tend to be used by the rivers today , and they &apos;re using chemical pollutants , flow of the water .
and if it was fought through the system , and this leaves is clean , as it &apos;s like it &apos;s a little bit of the water .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s harvested the water .
so not just a farm that you don &apos;t hate , not just a farm , which is your success of your breasts , but a farm that literally is a kind of a kind of fish , but not just for you and i &apos;m not just for you and i &apos;m not just for you and i &apos;m not just for you and i &apos;m not just for you and i &apos;m not just for you .
because if the water is , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because these love , like romantic also , is also also also also also also also a lot .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future good food , whether we talk about the future or a more of the time .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food actually taste good .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
we &apos;re not a more of the time , we &apos;re going to be a lover . we &apos;re lover .
we love farmers . we love small pieces of water , we talk about local food . we eat organic .
and if you say that the things that are the future of good food is somebody somewhere in the future , and says , &quot; hey people , i love the world , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;re producing enough calories to feed the world more than just to feed .
a billion people are going to be hungry today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of the most of the time , the environmental lucifer fascination in the distribution , not the gas gas .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because they &apos;re the logic of our most recent , the last 50 years .
feed grain , the most , is on the world , chemicals on earth , chicken on fish , and the whole time has the agribusiness just asked the agribusiness , &quot; if we &apos;re getting more people cheaper , how do you have to feed it ? &quot;
this was the cause . it was the census of the american agriculture .
we should call them what she is , a commodity in a sense , a separate , which is fast , which enables that production to be able to do that .
this is not a commodity , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our favorite system is threatened today , not because of the most of the time , it &apos;s because of the resources , but because of the resources , it &apos;s due to resources .
not through the latest , and the latest , but through fertile land , not by pump , but through fresh water , not by a very powerful , but not through the forests of fish , but through fish , but through fish in the sea .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that are going to motivate any community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in it , and it never has a really good thing to eat .
let &apos;s see the ecological model .
this is that , in two billion years , expertise .
look at the humanities , farmers like the humanities , like the humanities .
companies that are not worlds for themselves , companies , the creation of the creation , are going to be treated rather than just more , farmers , who are not only allowed to do it , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for
because they are the ones that are also experts for taste .
and if i really am honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i ever will be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if the future is good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to let you a deal with a thing , it &apos;s that the total data we consume is bigger than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking about it , i think , how we can use information that &apos;s going to be like that .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical amount of time to age age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called the so-called , and what i can do with a lot of death is that i can filter a certain cause of death .
and immediately , i see another pattern that makes it .
and that &apos;s because in the most remote , people are active and they &apos;re over here on the top of the world .
we can step further , and we can see the data then and see that the data and cancer is the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , if we go on and to age age , we &apos;re going to say 40 years or younger , we &apos;re even going to see that accidents are actually going to be concerned about the cause of people .
and who &apos;s going to see that is that it &apos;s true in men .
so you see that this is a little bit of information and data in this way in a living way .
and if we can do this for data , why not even do it for content itself ?
so what we &apos;ve got here is the most individual of the sport of every single sport , which ever had been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it for my talk in your rooms .
with the most remote you can get to a decade .
you can get to a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
so if i look at this , i see the athletes that appear in this copy and the sport .
i &apos;m a forger roosevelt fan , so i click here all the time in which lucas is mentioned .
now , if i want to get a little bit of a picture , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the subject of the subject ? &quot;
so i go back to a step and the view of the view .
now i see greg &apos;s .
and so you get an idea that if you &apos;ve done this kind of information , more powerful , bigger , you can &apos;t throw , or not just not just .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
it &apos;s something between it , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to do this idea a little bit further with what &apos;s a little crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we took every single one of the things , and they reduced them to a little summary .
the summary contains a short and a symbol of the area that it comes from .
i just show the top 500 of the middle of the world &apos;s top .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
and immediately we get a sense of the issues that are on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the theme of the government .
now , after i chose government , i know that the most important thing that most of the time is , the most of the time , is &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single single single place .
that &apos;s just to recognize if you go back and look at the whole .
so , let &apos;s take a ride in a certain of these summaries , and then i can actually be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to see people in the year .
so , if i look at all these people , i know that the majority of them are the majority of it . some come from science . some , even less , come from the economy .
and interestingly , bono is a ted prize .
so we can jump and look at all ted &apos;s prize .
you see , we &apos;re going to be surfing in the net , as if it &apos;s really a net , not just the side of the side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise could be .
i just show you the new york times .
and the application of this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites -- and we bring these up to each other .
so i can go back to a step , and right to a specific unit .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s important because you just look at the websites of websites in this kind of way , and the whole thing can look like .
so i can zoom in my course in a particular place .
here &apos;s the whole demonstration that i &apos;ve been thinking about here .
and i can do everything i &apos;ve seen today , again , again .
and , if i look back , and i can look at everything , i can also organize my course , and i can see my course of the course of my own . here i went to the &quot; i &apos;m looking for a new guinea , &quot; or here for live labs .
and i can go from here to the side and you go back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used again , and every time it makes it bigger than the sum of the world &apos;s sum .
now in this world , we think that data is a cyborg .
we &apos;re talking about the lucifer of the world &apos;s .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going from a different way to go from a lot of things , and that &apos;s what the pattern would be hidden .
if we can do this , then this is the moment that we can do this , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of moving in information , we can know from it .
and if we know , then we might even be able to make wisdom from it .
so i &apos;m listening to , thank you very much .
i grew up with a kind of a portion of science fiction .
in my school , i went to school to school every day , every day a hour .
and my nose always put in a book , a computer , which my thoughts in other worlds are resistant to other worlds and on the way my deep , more , more curiosity .
and this curiosity also showed that i was always when i was not in school , through the forests , and they went to the forest , and they went to the &quot; samples , frogs and ross and the beetle . &quot;
i was totally a very , very , white knowledge .
it was always about trying to understand the world and explore the boundaries of the possible .
and my love to science fiction seemed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in the late &apos; 60s , and then we flew the moon and explored the deep sea .
jacques whitesides came into our living room with his fascinating shows , which we showed animals and places of the miracle that we &apos;ve never heard before .
this is a very good thing to do in the world &apos;s most good way .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there &apos;s no video video that &apos;s still the way that we had a little bit of the imagery with a little bit of the imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we had to all of this , when we read a book , we took the description of the genius and the hippocampus of the the screen , and it &apos;s the screen in our heads .
my response to this was drawing and paint from aliens , aliens , robots , robots , and all of that .
in the southern department , i was constantly caught from teachers , as i was hiding in the textbook , hidden .
creativity had to be a lot of the way out .
and that &apos;s what happened to me , which was interesting , which is what jacques shows me , which was a thought of a very unknown world here on our earth .
certainly i would never get a alien world with a spaceship . that seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world i could actually go to the earth , and she was quite fascinating and exotic as all that i &apos;ve been able to have to read when i had read these books .
so i decided to be 15 , diver .
the only problem that i was in a small village was in canada , one kilometers from the next ocean .
i didn &apos;t have a surprise of that .
i &apos;m going to be my father , until finally , a computer in cairo , new york , and i &apos;ve been doing that on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my favorite in a pool of the middle of the winter in the winter in the winter in baghdad , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got to face two years later , when we moved to california .
since , in the 40 years , the 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about three hours of water , and 500 hours of it in the foyer .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the ocean , is so rich in the world , as we can actually imagine .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know borders , unlike our own , and the human imagination .
until today , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my co-author .
and my love to the ocean is holding up with the same intensity as the same .
when i was a adult job , it was the scarf .
that seemed the best way to tell my inner , stories to tell my need , to combine pictures .
as a child , i was constantly drew books and so .
so films were the way of getting pictures and stories . that &apos;s what they fit together .
of course , stories that i &apos;m going to do , from the most , is , &quot; terminator , &quot; and &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; the &quot; &quot; i could be my preference for the distance and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing with the pad .
so , sort of , my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; in order to solve a problem in this movie , and we had to create a kind of liquid of a liquid . &quot;
what came out of that was the first cloned , the first cloned , which was ever in a movie .
the film was not a money , just said , he was just playing his cost , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience on the world was like the magic of the magic , which was taken out of this .
according to arthur roth &apos;s law , the law is known by the law of the technology , and magic doesn &apos;t have more of each other .
so they saw something magical .
and that was what i found incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s actually going to be involved in the most remote . &quot;
so we went into &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; and the next film , still .
together , we created the guy there , and we &apos;ve got the guy out there , and the success was very , very , very , like this effect .
and it worked . we had created something magical , and the effect was the same thing , but we &apos;ve been with the film , but we &apos;ve been doing a little bit more money .
from these two experiences , a whole new world is achieved , a whole new world of creativity for the most of the time .
so i started a company , together with my good friend , who was at the time of the best , and it was called &quot; digital &quot; .
the idea of this company was , the phase of analog processes with visual printers , etc .
and then we did that , and we did a advantage of a time .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the most remote and more , and what we &apos;ve been doing is to slow up the company .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which is the bar in things visual effects and the effects of the whole new heights in the whole new heights , and the most significant thing that was made by the world , and the world should be the world &apos;s most , and the world should be the world &apos;s world . and the world should be the world &apos;s world . and the world should be the world &apos;s world .
but the bar was going to get out of it , and people in my company said that we don &apos;t have to be able to do that .
so i made this and made this other film over the big ship , which is going to fall .
and i have the most , &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but i actually wanted to wrap up the real train of the titanic .
so i did the film .
this is the truth . the studio knew that .
but i think they believe , by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to go to the train . we film the real train .
we &apos;re going to show it in the movie of the film .
this is incredibly important . it &apos;s a good kind of a good thing for marketing . &quot;
and i assure you to fund a expedition .
sounds crazy . but that &apos;s what &apos;s going back to the fact that your imagination can create reality .
we actually created a reality , and we actually put a reality in which i was going to go in a russian school , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i looked at the real titanic through a computer .
that was not a movie , no a movie , that was really .
so , that really occurred me .
and the exploration of the exploration were enormous . we had to build cameras and light and all kinds of things .
and i fell on how much these kinds of things , a computer design .
well , they were also more likely to act and more sophisticated planning .
you go into this capsule , you put in these dark , bright environments down where no hope is , if you don &apos;t get back to it .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s as much as i was in a computer .
this is really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , the part of curiosity and science has been doing it . it was all . it was an adventure . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that was not able to give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .
and in some of the next expeditions , i saw creatures in the world , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that had seen before , and for the science for the time we saw it , even no words had been found .
so that &apos;s really what i did , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met a little bit unusual .
after the success of &quot; titanic &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my favorite as a filmmaker in hollywood and will be a while for a while . &quot;
and then we started to put the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot;
we went back to the ladder of the titanic .
we took small robots that we built , which was a kind of a computer system .
our intent was , and the inner press was looking at the inner ship , which has never been done before .
nobody ever explored the inner of the world &apos;s inner system , and you didn &apos;t have any tools for that . so we developed technology .
and now i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a computer , and see the protests that are pretty similar to this , and i know that once the band has played there .
and i &apos;m flying with a little bit of a little bit of the ship .
i &apos;m actually tracking it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically within the titanic of the titanic .
that was the most , the form of a computer that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i was to take a corner of a corner , i knew what was going on in the brain &apos;s brain , because i went to the film .
so the set was a very precise copy of the hull of the ship .
so that was a very strange experience .
she made me aware that you use this kind of thing that you use , and that &apos;s how they use their consciousness in the vehicle , in these other form of existence .
it was really immensely profound .
and maybe a little bit of what might happen in some decades , if you have a lot of decades , to explore something or to do anything in all kinds of things that i can imagine as a computer .
after these expeditions , we started to see what we saw down there , really appreciate , for example , to be this kind of thing that we saw these incredibly amazing animals , but here on earth .
they live with the help of the dating .
they don &apos;t exist in a way of sunlight , like we do that .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
and i was also interested in the same time , and i was also interested in the same time that was the most important thing of my childhood .
and so i ended up with people who are interested in space and to do that with nasa and in the world &apos;s own , and the right thing , and they &apos;re going to go to russia , and they &apos;re going to go through the international record , and then they take our own .
this was fascinating .
but at the end , it was going to be that i took a lot of the deep time to the deep sea .
i took them to the world , and i &apos;m going to give you access to the world , and the world &apos;s , people who are interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to the sources of the sources , and so on , they could test the instruments and test instruments and test instruments and so forth .
we did it , but actually , science is actually , more specifically , said , &quot; well , the most efficient . &quot;
so the circle of my existence was as a child , as a child , and the reality in reality .
in the course of this voyage , i learned a lot of learning .
i learned a lot about science , but i think you &apos;re certainly thinking , a director , also , a director , is going to be a leader like a car or something like that .
but i don &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i get these expeditions .
because in a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
this is not a mess of movies that don &apos;t make us a money .
we just play the cost of the cost . from fame not .
all of you think i &apos;m between the titanic and &quot; avatar &quot; and i would have the nails somewhere on a towel on a towel on the beach .
i &apos;ve all got these films , these intuitions , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it about the task to the challenge -- and the ocean is the environment , which is there . you &apos;re doing it for the most strange connection , and because of the strange connection of people , if a little group of people form a team .
because we &apos;ve done all of this with 10 to 12 people who have been working on years , sometimes we were two to three months of a month .
and in this community , you see that the most important thing is that the most important thing you have , you have each other , because you &apos;ve made a task that you can &apos;t explain .
if you go back to land , and you say , &quot; we had to do it , the mexican , the most , and that &apos;s the whole technology , the whole technology , and the difficulty , the human performance , is not going to explain it . that &apos;s how you can &apos;t explain it . that &apos;s how you can &apos;t explain it .
there &apos;s a connection , a foreign respect .
so when i returned to the next film , &quot; avatar &quot; , i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it in return to respect .
so , that &apos;s the dynamics that was changed .
so , i was going to have a little team on a little bit of a team of the time , and we were born with a new technology that there was not yet .
incredibly exciting .
a tremendous challenge .
and we were for a period of four years to a real family .
so , my way to make films completely .
there were people who were saying , we would have been doing this very well , and the planet was transported to the planet .
for me , it was more a kind of a way to do my job , the real process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we close from all of this ?
what lessons do we learn ?
i think the first place is the curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can actually create reality .
and the argument of your team is more important than all of the world &apos;s most important world .
to me , young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice , how i can do something like that . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t even say you can &apos;t even be a .
that &apos;s what we do , you know , do it , don &apos;t do yourself , don &apos;t bet yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has such a kind of a more , &quot; fail is not an alternative . &quot;
but in the art , in the art and study , it needs an alternative , because there &apos;s a kind of a time .
no important endeavor , innovation was ever asked , the without risk .
you have to be ready to take risks on it .
that &apos;s the idea i &apos;d like to give you with the way that i want to do with you . failure is a alternative , but it &apos;s not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and that may be surprising , because my favorite , in the foundation of the foundation , is mainly vaccines and seeds to make things that we invent and deliver the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , just more important than any other thing on the planet .
and the fact is that their own oxide are not growing over many years , and we &apos;re going to grow too much or too little . the things are going to change how it can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do their fragile environment .
this leads to the most remote . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , a climate change is terrible for them .
and also , the most important thing for you is the most important thing for you .
the fact is , if you could only reduce one thing , it would be energy in the far more effective .
now the most , the most important thing about time .
in fact , the most important thing is based on the most remote .
the average revolution is going to go and have the industrial revolution in the 20th century , and that &apos;s why we have the refrigerators in the world , and so we have refrigerators , we can create modern materials and so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s give us the price -- let &apos;s meet a new barrier , and this barrier depends on co2 .
co2 is the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they &apos;re breaking the carbon co2 , which leads to the most remote and the most negative , and the brain &apos;s very negative consequences . effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to change and collapse all systems .
now , the exact context between a computer and the power of that is the way that you &apos;re going to be the other consequences , and where you &apos;re there , there are some of the things that are very much .
and there are certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to be . but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i asked the most few times , &quot; do we really have to go down to zero ?
isn &apos;t it enough to half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we come close to zero , the temperature will continue to go .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a 3.5 feet high truck , which has to be under a three feet bridge .
this is a very , very , very , on zero .
now , we &apos;re going to get a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a year , over 26 billion tons .
everybody americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons of tons of every on the planet .
and somehow we have to create changes that reduce that on zero .
it &apos;s very much up .
just different economic changes , it &apos;s all influenced and we need to go from the rise to reducing the rise of the rise to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of a little bit of a little bit . they have this thing -- co2 -- co2 -- that &apos;s going to be able to get zero and the number of people in average , the average energy .
so let &apos;s look at every factor of the world , and we think we get that to zero .
probably one of these numbers have to come very close to zero .
now that &apos;s fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first we have the population .
today , the humanities billion people live .
and it &apos;s going to go to nine billion years to move on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the most remote and the most , we might be able to reduce that 10 percent to 15 percent , but we see a slope to 1.3 percent .
the second factor is the services that we use .
this includes everything that we eat , clothing , television , heat .
these are very good things and the most good thing that means to do this services almost every on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to do it , and less use , but in average , this number will rise every year and so over the average , and so that the number of services are going to be put the one person .
so here we see a very fundamental service . there &apos;s light at home , so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their own .
well , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , is finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up , that &apos;s not rising .
because of different successes in the world , through other people , through new ways , there are lots of services in the world &apos;s own , and there are lots of services that are going to reduce the energy .
in other service , how to do the manufacturing of the world &apos;s , the u.s. bank : &apos; police : &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; / em : / d or the most remote , is the air , is very much smaller .
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a double factor to a factor three or maybe a factor six .
but at the first three factors , we &apos;ve been able to have the most basic 13 billion tons of tons of tons , and that &apos;s not enough !
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is a key -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that will be a unit of energy .
it turns out that you can get this on zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
almost every single one of the electricity for electricity today is co2 , except renewables and the most remote energy .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need the most of the time .
so if i use the term , i don &apos;t use the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these wonders .
usually there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to a certain date .
usually , you &apos;re just going to get wrong and some people don &apos;t get .
but in this case , we have to give up and get a miracle in very short time .
now , i asked myself how can i really get that ?
is there a natural involvement , a demonstration that &apos;s going to get the idea of people here ?
i remembered last year when i brought mosquitos and somehow liked people .
the idea was really a mess for them , you know that there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , this was a one .
i decided that this was what fireflies would be my favorite contribution to the environment here .
so here &apos;s a few natural fireflies .
you &apos;ve got to tell me that they don &apos;t bite . actually , they &apos;re not even leaving the glass .
well , there are all kinds of things like this , but they don &apos;t bring all of them .
we need solutions , either one or several , and a half the most rough scale and unimaginable . and even though there are many directions where people are looking for that , i really see five that can afford this big demands .
i &apos;ve left a tides , and i left fusion , fusion and biofuels .
and this may be a hammer , and if you &apos;re going to afford better than i expect , it would be great , but my punch line is that we have to work on all these five , because they &apos;re not going to give us a lot of problems .
let &apos;s first take the burning fossil fuels , burning from either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there is maybe just , but it &apos;s not , you have to do that , and you have to get all the co2 that comes from the sensory , and then they &apos;re hoping there &apos;s going to be .
there are some of the most little things that are on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it will be very difficult to get a very difficult one to get the environment , but the biggest problem here is the most challenging problem .
who will make sure ?
who can guarantee something , what literally many billion times larger than any of the waste you can imagine from the more of the waste and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a tough problem .
next : the next thing .
and that &apos;s also three big problems , the cost , especially in the world , especially in the world , and the question is , for safety , that you can really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the fuel of the fuel .
and what do you do with the garbage ?
because even though he &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of thinking .
so three very difficult problems that may be soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve been putting it up .
it &apos;s renewables like it often called it .
and also , even though it &apos;s great , it &apos;s not a fuel -- they have some refrigerators .
one is the energy efficiency that creates these technologies dramatically than the power of power .
these are the most powerful , you talk about many of the things , thousand times more surface than a normal power force .
and also , these sources of sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem to be the whole day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be every day and just the wind .
so you have to depend on these sources , and you have a way to have energy in times when you &apos;re not available to get .
so there &apos;s big amounts of things here , and there are challenges in the transmission , if we say that the energy source is outside the country , you don &apos;t need to only deal with the risk that the energy from where different people come from where different .
and there &apos;s the most powerful thing .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve all got all kinds of batteries that are made , looking at cars , computers , mobile phones , and i found that all the batteries that are using the world . i found that all the batteries that are using , and i found that all the batteries that are using , compared to the world , compared to the world .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be 100 better than the approaches to time .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
that happens when you try to say this , these are the ones that we &apos;re trying to say , we &apos;re going to get 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest of the rest .
if you want to support 100 percent of it , you need an incredible computer system .
now , where should we go : what is the right approach ?
one of the manhattan &quot; ? how do we come to the goal ?
what we need is many companies that work on it . hundreds of them .
in each of these five areas we need at least 100 people .
in many ways , they &apos;re going to say , these are crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there &apos;s a lot of the ones that are already there .
bill big has several companies , under other people called the great most powerful .
and the most powerful thing to do is invest in dozens of companies , and they have a great opportunity to support and i try to support this .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that , maybe surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the world &apos;s most , liquid , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry some time , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are leaving .
the most , the most , is that instead of a part of the most of the most of the most of the most , the one percent , the most , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the most powerful .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it long , but you could never simulate reasonable , whether it would work , but since then , there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and you see , yes , it &apos;s like that .
and because you burn these 99 percent , the most much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of the reactors as a result of the day .
instead of breaking the head , they just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium will use incremental , a little bit like a candle .
you see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often as a traveling wave of reactor .
it really makes the most important thing .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part of that , so it &apos;s called the phosphorus , so it &apos;s called uranium .
the more of the u.s. u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re going to get a cheap and simple , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many of the concepts that we need to get forward .
so let &apos;s think of how we should measure our success .
how should our testimony look ?
now , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to reach and then talk about the most of us .
many of the 80 percent reduction from 2050 to 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something agriculture is going to be , hopefully , and it &apos;s going to be clean to clean up .
so to reach these 80 percent , the developed developed countries , including china , their own , their own , completely change .
the other note says if we use the technology technology , whether they &apos;re used in all countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
this is great important .
this is a key key of this kind of thing .
if we go back there , how should the 2020 look like this ?
it should have the two elements .
we should use the most remote to bring reduction to the way . the less we &apos;re going to be the less , the lower , the lower , and also the temperature .
but actually , this note is to be the things that we &apos;re not completely doing to the big , just the same , or even less important than the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
these breakthroughs have to track with the most remote and we can measure that , in the world , in the world , in the world , and the most remote .
there are many great books to this topic .
al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david &apos;s energy energy &quot; the hot air system . &quot;
they &apos;re really going to go through and create a frame where this can be banned by the wide , because we need to support all of the pages .
there &apos;s a lot of that together .
this is a wish .
a very specific wish that we invent this technology .
if you just take a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i could choose , or i could choose this wish , which is , i think , the wish of the wish .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the dig between the long and a short person is being terrible , between the united states and china , between poor and rich , and almost all of these two billion will be very bad .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do ?
we need to use more research for more research .
if countries are making themselves in places like the world &apos;s places , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should discuss these kinds of things and they would be shocked by the ridiculous little disabled , which are spent for these innovative approaches .
we need the most , carbon control , carbon &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ;
we need to spread the message .
we need to make dialogue more rational and the things that are going to be done by the government .
it &apos;s a more important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you !
thank you . just to understand something better -- just to understand , can you give us an idea of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to make the simulation on a supercomputer , all the great scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we need just some 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure it &apos;s a little bit of it .
the difficult step is building the first fishing record , to find more billion , the most important and the place in fact .
once the first thing is , when he &apos;s going to be like that , it &apos;s all very clear , because the power of the power , the energy efficiency is so different as we know .
so to understand that , that means deep to build the ground almost like a vertical column nuclear , that built the process and then work on the top , and it &apos;s going to go down to the bottom ?
and the thing is , right now , you have to have the reactor to get new , so there &apos;s lots of people and many control that can go wrong . this thing is not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can get it to 60 years -- think about a column -- you put it down , without the whole complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and burns 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
a more of the time that &apos;s a solution to the garbage .
and so , yes , yeah . now , what happens to the garbage : you can sit on it -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it and burn it on the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the waste , which is already that exists in these kinds of things or the reactors in the reactors . that &apos;s our most powerful .
so , what &apos;s a problem for these reactors was that what we put in our hands and it will reduce the most dramatic as this process .
but as you talked about different people of these world .
where is the biggest interest , what really do you do ?
and so , we &apos;ve been talking about this , and we haven &apos;t been able to put it on a place and there &apos;s a lot of interesting things for everything called nuclear &quot; in the name . there &apos;s big interest and people in russia , india , india , and i &apos;ve been talking about how this fits to the brain .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something in the direction .
this is a programmer that was made .
this is a more important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries , so everybody who has been made a quick reactor , a little bit of a quick reactor for our first .
in your imagination , is that a little bit of the probability of calling the way to call it to life ?
and so , we need one of these of the most remote things , and we need to do this , a lot of the things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to use .
this is sort of the deadline that has shown us the most of us that we have to be able to do .
and , you know , the most good thing , if everything goes good , and that &apos;s a great wish , that could keep easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of companies that are working , as their approaches work , which works for their pilots , for the pilots .
and it would be best if there &apos;s several , because then you could use a mixture .
and we need a solution to each other .
so , the big kinds of breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing that you know ?
and the most important thing is , a more important thing is .
it would have been without the most important , but it &apos;s also so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know the work as well as this , but there &apos;s the treaties that is another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid of a liquid , which seems to seem hard , but maybe the ones that are going to say about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the beautiful thing is that a million times a million times a million times as much energy , say , &quot; we can say , a , and that &apos;s why the potential , and the cost , and the cost , and the cost , and the impact , and the cost , and the cost , and the cost , and the impact , and the cost , and the cost , and the cost , and the impact , and the cost , and the cost , and the cost
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to be able to put a lot of the way to try to keep the most stable stable ?
and so , if you get into this situation , it &apos;s as if you eat too much , and a heart attack is , and what you do is you need a heart problem or something like that .
there &apos;s a research research called the research that &apos;s called the different techniques to take the warming to the warming , so we have 20 or 30 years longer to get us to the world .
this is just a kind of a more a .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you don &apos;t just want to work on insurance because maybe a fake power is , you know , you &apos;re eating that one of the leading life is going to save .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart when you &apos;re going to get the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in the world , whether you should have that to get the things faster , or that innovation needs longer than we expect .
climate change : do you have a or two sentences for that , maybe to convince you ?
and so , the most , unfortunately , is the skeptic in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say there are negative effects to do with the clouds that are moving things ?
there are very , very few things that you can tell at all , from which it &apos;s a chance of a million .
the main world here is like aids .
you &apos;re doing the mistakes now , and you pay a lot later for it .
and so , the idea is , now , if you all have a different problem , to invest in something that you just have later -- and that &apos;s where investment is not so clear . actually , it &apos;s not the worst scenario .
the fact is that these uncertainty should make us worry .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economically , and the co2 is going to be being achieved , then the skeptic says , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not a carbon , i wish it &apos;s not a carbon . &quot;
and that would be the answer to the most , the idea of the most , that if you use all these time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals are suffering by malaria and so on , it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources that are going to be done .
and so , the actual spending for the research -- say , we should spend the u.s. u.s. 10 billion a year than you do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
and below other things , others don &apos;t suffer .
and you get to big money , and here can disagree reasonable people , if you have something that &apos;s not economically , and trying to fund that . for me , the most waste is going to be here .
because it &apos;s very short , you &apos;re very short in front of a computer and funded the learning . i think we should try to try and try to be more things that have potential .
if the cartoonist you get , a very high , very high , is just the rich .
i mean , everybody &apos;s one of us could spend five times so much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even more , it &apos;s thinking .
his new computer system is now , &quot; why don &apos;t the research are going to be talking about ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to be because of his former stories , with the most devastating stories , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and therefore he &apos;s going to get the most devastating .
and that &apos;s a train that i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , like a little bit of people who are going to support .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking for almost all people here , when i say , i &apos;m really hoping that you &apos;re going to be true . thank you very much .
and the thing is : thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , peter , peter &apos;s a computer named &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
the idea is quite simple . the biggest thing must be the biggest world &apos;s biggest , the biggest of the world &apos;s largest , about 20 pounds , about feet feet , and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be up to the top .
and , even though it really seems to be really hard , it &apos;s really hard to work because people are very fast working .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve turned it into a more a more .
it was a huge success .
since i did about 70 workshops , i did about 70 workshops in the world , with students , engineers and architects , even with the most remote , and there &apos;s something that makes deep sensations in nature , and i want to share some of them .
usually most people start to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
they talk about it , you think , you &apos;re going to look at it .
then they invest a little bit in planning and organization . they &apos;re calling and put spaghetti .
they &apos;re investing in the most common of their time in the world &apos;s .
and finally , before they don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow and they put it down to the top , and they &apos;re going to go back to the top , and they admire the work .
but what &apos;s going on , almost always happens , is that the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there &apos;s a series of people who have much more &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and they really produce the form of the form .
and of course , there are teams that have a lot more &quot; more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and under the best , &quot; and the best student of the world &apos;s .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , they didn &apos;t just make the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is : how does this come ? why ? what about that ?
and peter tells you , &quot; no one of the kids are going to be in the head of the spaghetti . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in the world .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that &apos;s the fact that the most successful plan were trained to find a right plan , ok !
and then it &apos;s to realize .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s going to do is that they &apos;re going to start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow of the top , so they have the opportunity to fix the opportunity .
and the way that we can see this kind of collaboration is the core of a computer &apos;s core .
and with each trial , the kids are going to get immediately feedback , which works and what not .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , much -- but we &apos;re going to see how different teams are acting .
the average for most of the is about the most important , and the average , is doing half of it , lawyers , but not much , not much , more than adults .
who is most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
the oldest thing i &apos;ve seen is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they &apos;re understanding triangles and they &apos;re the key geometric patterns of building robust structures .
ceos are something about average . but here it is interesting .
put a charity on the team , you &apos;ll be significant better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see around and see &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why does this happen ?
because they have special skills of the world &apos;s own .
they &apos;re fighting the process , they understand it .
and this team , which is going to be able to look at the power of the team of the team .
and so , more potent skills and the combination of success and their combination .
if you have 10 teams , the typical thing , you get about six , the robust structures .
i tried something interesting .
i thought we &apos;re going to bring the same thing .
so i offered a 10,000 dollars to the winner for the winner .
what did you think happened with these kinds of things ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone had built a high high construction , he would have carried the price home .
so is it not interesting that high amounts of light have a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
what did you think happened ?
now they understood the advantage of the &quot; prototyping . &quot;
so , from the same , bad team of a under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there &apos;s a lot of lessons for us , and we &apos;re going to be concerned about nature and success .
you like to ask : why would someone actually invest a time to create a more of the time ?
the reason is , i help digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games , and &quot; visual &quot; to create .
and what the most important thing is , you can identify them hidden assumptions .
because open , every project has his own marshmallow .
the challenge is a common experience , a common language , or a commodity , the right prototype to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this is so simple practice .
and those of you who are interested in the way that they can go .
it &apos;s a blog where you see the marshmallow .
there &apos;s a more of the time there .
they find crazy examples of all the world , as people optimize the system and the most remote .
there are also a lot of things .
and the most , i think , is that i think it &apos;s actually a kind of a sport sport .
it requires that we all have our senses on the task and we &apos;re going to use our thinking , how our feelings and our do , in the challenge , that lies in front of us .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that it needs to get us from one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
let &apos;s do this as a machine here .
a big machine , a cool machine , and that &apos;s a machine machine .
and everybody in this room has to be in this room .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now stay here .
and i wonder what you would choose because i &apos;m often asked my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to time before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america &quot; or &quot; america . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced you kind of a lot of the suburbs , to be drawn to the suburbs .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go in the past , and that &apos;s because i &apos;m a marker .
it &apos;s that opportunities are not going back to this planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that the most important thing that they &apos;ve ever had on this planet , whatever they &apos;re doing : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , opportunities .
there was never a time like this .
my favorite student died all the time they were 60 .
my grandparents are asking this number of 70 to 70 .
my parents are 80 on the most remote .
so there should be a nine on the beginning of my favorite , and there &apos;s a nine on my own .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child that &apos;s born in new delhi can be done as long as the richest man on the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . the smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;ve shaped the demographics of the earth in a way , like not war ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we have them . pop .
in the rich world , diseases exist , the millions of us have only threatened by one generation , hardly yet .
and the most , most of the time , polio , polio ...
anybody still knows what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , that are successes of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method , things try to try and look , look , it &apos;s changing , if it doesn &apos;t do that , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so this is the good news .
unfortunately , this is the whole good news , because there &apos;s some other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , there &apos;s a billion people going to bed every day .
this number rises , and they &apos;re very fast , and that &apos;s a shame .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to make this world happen .
drinking water , the armed country , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , and if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , we &apos;re also not going to disappear from this chaos .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think it &apos;s already .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food , which is the billions of people who are going to feed the country , to rape them .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t have to be destroyed at the same time .
i think that really , and no , that &apos;s not a more of the time .
but this is what i hold on night -- one of the things that hold me awake at night . we never needed scientific progress as well as now , never , still , never , still , never , still , never , still , never , still , never , still , never , still , never , still , never , still , never , still , never , still , never , still , never , still , never , still , never , still , never , still , never , still , never ,
and we were still able to be able to do it reasonable , like we can today .
we &apos;re at the threshold to amazing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think we have to go hundreds , 300 years ago , to find a time where we have to fight progress in the world we have to do .
people are going to be able to be in their faith , and that &apos;s how so closely you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth is going to free it .
and listen , everybody has a right on his opinion . even a right on its opinion .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
they don &apos;t have right on their own facts . &apos; &apos; sorry , they don &apos;t .
and i took a while to figure out that .
about a decade ago , i &apos;ve written an article about immunization for the new york , a little article .
and i was amazed to get resistance on resistance , on the end of what the most effective activity in health care is in human health .
i didn &apos;t know what i should do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote a paper and went on .
and soon , i wrote a article about clean food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people played crazy .
so i wrote a paper , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the molecules on a certain way of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept going to go .
i mean , i &apos;m journalist , i &apos;m journalist .
we type , we &apos;re going to eat a lot , we &apos;re going to eat that .
but this article made me worry , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it .
and that &apos;s that these subjects , which were crazy at all , were not a user .
these were people who were educated people , subtle people .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and that brought me so mess ...
but then i thought , you know what , we &apos;re honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as earlier .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we talk ironic about this , with little quote : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what the reasons that is .
we have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why that shouldn &apos;t be like that .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
chernobyl , the slope , the slope , the federal mass , mass weapons , the most remote 2,000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people that we believed , they &apos;re always right . so , they &apos;re skeptical .
imagine questions , ask evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything as there .
but now , when you have to get evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can say that we &apos;re going to live in a epidemic of fear , like i never saw it and hopefully .
about 12 years ago , a story published a story , a terrible story that the most profound thing that the the minimum , and the vaccine has brought up .
very scary .
and the other studies were done to see if that was true .
and the other studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe , we believe what we see , what we &apos;re seeing is what we &apos;re really feeling .
we don &apos;t believe in a donor documents of a computer , which gives us data , and i understand that , i think , we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of it was catastrophic , a catastrophic , the result of it .
catastrophic because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries on the world where the self-organizing for hyperbolic .
this is a lot of the time , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happens is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because anybody here has a minimum ?
has a single one in the audience , and the person &apos;s .
not very often .
in this country , it doesn &apos;t happen at all , but it &apos;s the world in the last year .
these are many deaths through hyperbolic , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not happening here , we can do it in denial , and people like jenny can walk around and the messages of fear and larry king .
and you can do that because they don &apos;t connect and link to connection .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and that &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas &apos;s crew .
he was screaming from one of the worst most recent of humanity .
no fear , no one , polio , zinc , disappeared .
the guy in the middle of the middle isn &apos;t so much .
he &apos;s called paul &apos;s name .
he &apos;s just developed a few other people in a few other people .
he can save life from the world &apos;s lives , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
now , this is good , except that paul goes out and talk about vaccines and says how valuable they are , and that people should stop to animate .
and it &apos;s actually saying that .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul is talking in a public , he can &apos;t talk without armed guards .
he gets calls home , because people like to tell him that they know where their children go to school .
and why ? because paul has done a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
take it forward , return the disease , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s what happens .
we now have a minimum in this country now .
and that &apos;s going to be worse , and it &apos;s very soon going to be children dying , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just dying of hyperbolic .
what about polio ? let &apos;s take this . why not ?
a few weeks ago , i wrote a few weeks ago , and i said , i &apos;m a little too sharp .
nobody ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t be able to do your child against polio . no one .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
we had no polio in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe somebody in lagos is going to go in a plane and flies in los angeles , and it &apos;s just about ohio .
and in a few hours , he &apos;s going to land and a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these a little bit of a sudden .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a comprehensive disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because that &apos;s what the world works now .
this is the planet we live on . don &apos;t do that as if it &apos;s not .
we love to be in lying . we love that .
do you all have all their vitamins ?
and a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of them that helps you to be able to do it .
i know that they did that because half the americans do this every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference , as often as we find out that they &apos;re useless .
the data is all going to happen .
they &apos;re going to be their urine . more they never never do .
this is okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i &apos;m completely lucky to do .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the construction industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and that &apos;s not what we should do . our health system is a tofu .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing and more of us to do that , which can afford it .
so we &apos;re running away before , and where do we walk ?
we &apos;re running in the poor of the world &apos;s arms .
this is great . i love the most .
but you know , that &apos;s really a serious issue , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars to it .
and i &apos;ve all got a different little stomach here .
no one -- the most , it was , the most , was , in fact , , i don &apos;t know what that is , but we give billions of dollars to it , it &apos;s been .
and you know what ? if i say that , people , and say , &quot; what cares about it ? let &apos;s do people , what they want .
so you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you have wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the minister of defense , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or any of the things that are going to treat his patients with a patient .
if you go to this path , where think and magic evidence and science , they get to a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they get to the most remote of the south africa in south africa .
he brought 400,000 of his people to because he was that red , the red , and a lot more effective than the rooftops of drugs that we know that they know that they can be able to be able to get the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of yemeni death deaths in a country that will be worse than any other of these disease .
please don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
they have . they have always .
well , the most , the epidemic we &apos;re in , is that this is a bloody struggle between the most remote food food and the most remote .
this is a kind of a debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every single branch , every branch , every mammal , has changed by people .
you know , there was no more a computer in paradise .
there was no more a more of the time .
there was no more a more of the time . we did all this .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them worked and not .
we &apos;re raised , which doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more closely , and of course , there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people to extend their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re going to be able to get food off .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m always listening to is to be a lot of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , hormones , we don &apos;t want a huge fields to do that .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
we don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
and you know what my answer is to all this ?
yes , they &apos;re right . fix that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge amount of water , but that &apos;s not science .
that &apos;s nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , the most , more , more , more .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes he works and sometimes not , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work because we have fear of the fda , and it keeps millions of people from the villagers .
you know , in the next 50 years , we will have to grow 70 percent more food than the moment . 70 percent .
these investment in africa in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . honey .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? clean changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this kind of stuff , like , for example , to be a mess .
and it &apos;s a little bit of a billion people eating a half billion people .
it &apos;s about like a cabinet .
it &apos;s just a range of calories . it &apos;s a joint .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are building all this .
and then people could eat the food and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t be caring , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be a servant , but it would be beautiful .
and everything i can say to you is : why do we fight that ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why do we fight that ?
because we don &apos;t want to move genes ?
it &apos;s not about that , gene around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our lips on greater food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it will be the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do that as far as we do , we &apos;re going to think about something that we think , not guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what happens here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of our , and we need to really stop that .
so , after that incredibly funny conversation , you might say , &quot; do you want to say , &quot; you still want to go into this ridiculous machine machine and the future ? &quot;
on every case . that &apos;s what i want to do .
now , in the present , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this machine machine on everything we want .
we can move them forward where we want to move them , and we &apos;re going to move them to where we want .
we need to have these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the machine machine , we &apos;re going to be happy to have that .
i know we can , and it &apos;s a little bit of me that &apos;s going to need the world now .
thank you .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been interested in the most few time , and it may seem strange to be a magician that &apos;s interested in this , because it &apos;s like me , as i think , as a deception , that &apos;s going to be a real thing . &quot;
with other words , sugar sugar has shown a measurable effect , which is the most elegant effect , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what happens with her , is a kind of a , or a kind of ...
a deception is going to be a real thing because somebody is going to recognize it .
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , very simple trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least since the 1950s in every single time for children .
i &apos;ve learned him from the most of the time of the proton in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain him .
so , look what happens .
the knife that you can study , my hand , you can study that .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my own .
i &apos;m going to go back to my sleeves .
and to ensure that nothing in my sleeves is going to go out or come out of him , i &apos;m just going to be my wrist right here .
and you can see that you can &apos;t see anything that &apos;s going to move to a time , and as long as i &apos;m here , nothing is going to go in my sleeves or come out .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes good , the knife will be held through my naked physical .
it &apos;s actually so solid in his place that i can shake it without the knife .
nothing goes in my sleeves or comes out , no more , and you can study everything .
and the most , in the way !
now , this is a trick i often have little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn very much about deception , if you &apos;re very simple , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you here in the room here in the room .
he works like this : it works .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to be my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeves or outside , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m my wrist , is that it &apos;s the real secret of the illusion .
because in the moment , where i &apos;m my hand of you , so you see them from the back , that finger is , i &apos;m just moving from here , my heterosexual , just where he was , in a position he was so smooth .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody sitting on the back of somebody who didn &apos;t have childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i &apos;m going to get to the finger , the finger changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is an illusion , why you don &apos;t realize that there are only three fingers down there , because the mind and the way he does information is not allowed to be influenced by one , two , three , three , three , but they see it as a group .
but that &apos;s what it &apos;s about now , and then i don &apos;t open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s going to be been held , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my heterosexual , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by putting me through this movement , that the finger is going to be a little bit more .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can show you your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what about the most of the time ?
one year ago , i read a study that really has been really fooled me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and that &apos;s why it was a amazing thing for me .
because it turns out , if you offer a placebo in a white pill , the shape of a white pill is just a round , white pill , which has a certain measurable effect .
but if you give the shape that you give the placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and that blue is going to make it , and it &apos;s a letter that is actually measurable .
and that , although no one of them -- it &apos;s just sugar waves .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really did me escape .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
if you take a plastic , the more effective than pills are .
a colored capsule , which is in a end of yellow and the other red , is better than a white capsule .
the cuts is a role .
a pill is not a single day , not as well as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics .
but the key but is , ...
... that also is the doses of the magnet .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate most recent , you have to reach to needle .
right ? a syringe with a kind of a kind of a -- a few of the most little things that you &apos;re doing is a patient &apos;s substance .
this creates a very strong picture in the head . that &apos;s very much stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really ... i &apos;m going to show you another time if we have a spiral of a spiral .
so , the white pill is not so good as the blue pill , which doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and nothing of it has really been a really powerful property . it &apos;s just our belief that &apos;s made in us a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and let &apos;s look really look at it .
we know that we have to reach out of this study that you need to reach to the needle if it &apos;s going to go to the thing .
this is a 18 inches long , and it &apos;s very , very supportive . and i &apos;m going to be a little bit of it .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not a special kind of thing that &apos;s going on .
this is my skin . this is not a special part of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin , and you &apos;re going through it through them until they &apos;re going to turn back on the other side .
if you &apos;re going to get bad -- if you fall easily in the fall -- i &apos;ve shown a couple of friends last night , and some people who i didn &apos;t know , and it &apos;s a woman almost a bust .
so i propose if you &apos;re going to be quick , you &apos;ll look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first sensitive part here .
you can see it right now , but you can also be able to do it , if you want .
so , it &apos;s like that , where my meat starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little bit of a bloody .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you do that crazy ?
and now just a little bit of my skin and on the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the same situation .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . that &apos;s one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah , well , yeah , yeah , well , yeah .
i know what people think if you see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid and the skin itself , just to talk to us a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;m going to show you .
how does this look like this ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people say , &quot; okay . i don &apos;t have seen this right . &quot;
people in the world &apos;s own now come in .
let me show you from the near .
this is really my skin . that &apos;s not a special thing from hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can tear it up .
sorry . if you &apos;re bad , you &apos;re looking at it , look at it .
people , and the ones that later , the later , is going to say , &quot; well , that &apos;s what &apos;s pretty impressive , but if it was real , it would be a hole , and if it really was really , it would be a hole and it would be , if it really was really , it would be a hole and it was , if it really was really , it would be a hole and it was , if it really was really , it would be a hole and it was ,
okay , let me take a little blood for you .
yes , here &apos;s it .
i usually would take the needle off .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this frame here , and with the intention , from a deception , i &apos;m going to just make a real needle in there , and i &apos;m going to go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to meet a few times a few times .
i hope you &apos;re happy to do it . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness today .
i &apos;ve been able to count some people the number of books that were published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness under researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of more sophisticated .
everybody would like to make happier .
but despite all of these tide , there are several cognitive , which is a lot of cognitive , which is not really impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is going to be going to act by these cognitive .
that &apos;s true for the spatial , which is about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out that we are exactly as mess as everyone .
the first of these fall is a kind of a , complexity .
it turns out that the word is not a useful word , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could be able to be able to be able to be able to get it , but in the big and all the time that we need to give you a complicated perspective , and we will take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is a very clear one , and memory : basically it &apos;s between happy , and they &apos;re happy to live in his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both of the most common in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the most successful , and that &apos;s the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that well-being affects without to explain its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive representation .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with a example of someone who had a kind of a computer of mine , which was a story of mine . &#91; unclear &#93; , he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and it was absolutely beautiful .
and then he added it , really quite emotional , that &apos;s all the experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it had was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had been a $ 20 minutes of music .
it &apos;s not because he was a memory of a memory ; the memory was ruins , and the memory was everything he had to keep .
what &apos;s really telling us that we could think about ourselves and other people think about the other people in the sense of two ways .
there &apos;s a more of the time that lives in the present and the present , and the present is able to experience the past , but basically the present has .
it &apos;s the most important self that &apos;s the doctor &apos;s doctor -- you know , if the doctor asks , &quot; do it hurt now when i &apos;m here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a more of the time , and the most , the most , is that the most , the most , and the story of our lives , and it &apos;s the story of the doctor , and it &apos;s the doctor &apos;s question , &quot; how did you feel like it &apos;s been felt like ? &quot;
or &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or so similar .
these are two very different units that are the most different self and the most , and the two to the people &apos;s most is part of the most common of the world &apos;s happiness .
well , the most , the most , the a storyteller itself is a storyteller .
and that &apos;s really starting with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories if we do that , to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories that are going to be able to keep what we &apos;re going to keep from our experiences .
and let &apos;s start with an example of one example .
there &apos;s a old study .
these are real patients who put a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful than this study in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who &apos;s got more suffered ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has clearly suffered more . his favorite , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much thought these patients , that they suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise : this is a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient has a much worse than the patient &apos;s patient b.
the stories of the world &apos;s different , and because a very important part of the story is like it ends -- like it ends --
and no one of these stories is very much more powerful or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is clear than the other .
and that , the worse is where the pain was very on the end of his peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
where do we know that ?
because we asked these people to be asked to their own , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing in total ? &quot;
and she was a lot worse for b in the world &apos;s most worse .
well , this is a direct conflict between the most remote self and the most remote self .
from the world &apos;s most , b was clearly a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient a do , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s done , you could actually make the amount of patient a increase by the patient without to shake the tube without too much to him .
that &apos;s going to lead that the patient is suffering , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you &apos;ve got a few minutes , you &apos;ve been doing that , the most bad self is the most bad one , and you have it , that the most important self is a much better story , because now , you &apos;ve given patient a better story about his experience .
what is a story of that ?
and that &apos;s true for stories that makes us memory and it &apos;s true for stories that we invent .
what &apos;s a story of a story is a lot of a sudden , significant moments and end .
end , very , very important and in this case , the end .
well , the most , the most , life itself lives .
it has moments of the most of the time , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve been doing this -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds . what means that there are about 600 million of them .
most of you will completely ignored by the most of the time .
and yet , they &apos;re kind of getting the impression that they should count that what &apos;s happening during this moments of the world &apos;s lives .
it &apos;s the limited resource we use during this world .
and as we would use them , it &apos;s important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the most of us .
so we have the most remote self , and the most remote self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is to deal with time .
from the course of the world &apos;s self , if you have a holiday , and the second week is exactly how the first one is , the most good vacation is twice as well as the most important vacation .
this is not what it works for the most of the time .
for the most of the time , it &apos;s hardly a little bit better than the most of the time , because there &apos;s no new memories of the vacation .
they don &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that &apos;s different from a computer self , and time has very little influence on this story .
well , the most important self is doing more than remember and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually a little bit of the decisions that is true , because if you have a patient , we have two of the things that we have to choose , and decide what he should choose , then the one that &apos;s going to be the one that &apos;s going to be touched by the memory , which is the one that &apos;s going to be touched by the memory .
the most , the most , has no voice in this choice .
we don &apos;t really choose to do with experiences . we choose to do with memories .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think about our future as a experience .
we think about our future as a more than a human memories .
and basically , you can look at that , you know , as a swarm of the world &apos;s own , and you can think of the most , the most little , that &apos;s a kind of the most important self that &apos;s not going to need to be the most important self .
i have the impression that if we make vacation that &apos;s very often , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing in vacation in the middle of the world &apos;s services .
and that &apos;s a little bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we do from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that will given the dominance of the world &apos;s dominance .
and when i think about that , i think i &apos;ve done a holiday that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in antarctica that was clear , which i &apos;ve ever had , and i think , pretty often , in the relationship , how often i think of other things .
and i probably have the memories of my memories , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had opened the folder with 600 images , i spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and these are just a hours .
there &apos;s a holistic inversion .
now , i like to be a little bit of sure , you know , how little appetite i have on the world &apos;s most , but even if you &apos;re doing more of it , why are we going to give memories to the weight of the weight that we &apos;re doing ?
so i want you to think about a thought .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the world &apos;s end , all of your images are being wiped out and you get a drug drug , so that you &apos;re not going to remember anything .
now , would you choose the same holiday ?
and if you &apos;re going to choose another holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species of self and you have to think about how they decide that conflict and it &apos;s really not obvious because if you think of the senses of time , you can get a different answer .
why we choose the most , which we choose is a problem that is going to be a choice between the two species of self .
now , the two kinds of self throw two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply to one self .
so you can ask : how happy is the most important self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments of life in the life of self ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea from happiness to the time .
if you ask the happiness of the most surprising self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
that &apos;s not how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s like satisfied or pleased the person , if this person thinks about their life .
very different term .
everybody who &apos;s not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of researchers .
the distinction between the happiness of the self &apos;s happiness is in the last few years , and now , you &apos;ve been doing that , and now you &apos;re going to be able to measure the two people .
the orthopedic organization has a worldwide survey , which has been asked more than half a million people who have been asking about what they think about their lives and over their experiences . and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started learning about the happiness of the two species of self .
and the main lesson we think , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and it really teaches them to be a lot of how happy he lives and the vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation that is about the correlation of the correlation .
what that means is that if you would meet somebody , you would tell you , oh , his father is a kind of a , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody &apos;s life has been as eight in a scale of 10 , and they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he &apos;s with his favorite self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what happiness is determined to .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly , to be happy with people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two species of self , you &apos;re going to do very different things .
the conclusion of what i said here is that we &apos;re really not supposed to imagine that we &apos;re really lucky to think of the well-being of well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very short , another reason that we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are going to be in california , they &apos;re not going to get the correct answer .
if you think about this question , you think that people have to be happier when they say , in ohio , we &apos;re living in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference , we say , in climate .
now , it turns out that climate is not very important for the most important self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the most devastating self , which decides how happy people are .
but , because the most devastating self is responsible , you can go on the end -- some people could go to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to people who are moving to california , happier to become happier .
now , you &apos;re not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . they &apos;re going to think they &apos;re happier because if they &apos;re going to think about it , they &apos;re going to be remembered how awful the weather was in ohio . and they &apos;re feeling that they &apos;ve met the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve got a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you .
now , when we mentioned a few weeks ago , she told me that there was a pretty interesting result that came from this booking survey .
is that something you can do , because you &apos;re going to have a few minutes left ?
daniel &apos;s : sure .
i think the most interesting result we found in the auditorium is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found that in terms of the happiness of the self itself .
if we looked at how feelings are thrown with income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars , for americans , and that &apos;s a very big sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample of a income of 600,000 dollars a year of 600,000 dollars a year of 600,000 dollars a year of 600,000 dollars a year of 600,000 dollars a year of 600,000 dollars a year of 600,000 dollars a year of 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
and the question : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they &apos;re increasingly happy , the poorer they will be .
we get a absolutely flat line about this .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen so flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money is not a more of the time , but that lack of money is certainly a misery , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the most of the time , you get another story .
the more money you deserve is the happier .
it &apos;s not for emotions .
but danny , in the entire american effort , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this seriously seriously , i mean , it seems to be all the time to ask all of what we believe , for example , in terms of the world &apos;s , and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country is generally a more of the time , and do it based on politics ?
and so , you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of the world &apos;s role in politics .
the recognition will be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening and in other countries , they just happen .
people are in the way that they should think about happiness if they think about politics .
it will take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to study the way they want to study the way they want to study the discussion , so we need to lead this discussion pretty soon .
how you can increase happiness is very different , how you think and whether you think about it , or whether you think about the most remote self .
that will affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you &apos;re going to measure the most , the most important of the population .
that &apos;s what i think , in the next one , or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this topic , or should the most interesting political debate to track the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny , danny .
i &apos;m jane . i design video games .
so i &apos;ve been developing for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in reality , like you &apos;re in the world .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including them , including all of them , more time with the rest of the greater and more games .
now we spend three billion hours a week with a week .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a whole lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time , if you think about how many problems we &apos;re facing in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute of the future is exactly the opposite minimum .
three billion hours per week , not nearly enough to solve the most important problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that time dramatically .
i &apos;ve been able to calculate that the time that it was in 21 billion hours a week .
this is perhaps a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , so i &apos;m going to repeat it , so that &apos;s what we can do , if we &apos;re in trouble , poverty , global conflicts and obesity , i think , to play , and we have to try to play games online for least 21 billion hours a week .
no , i really mean it .
why ? this picture describes pretty precisely why i think games are so critical for survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of photographers phil .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play . so he has built a camera .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you don &apos;t have a player , maybe you &apos;re going to get some of the nuances in this picture .
you probably see this sense for urgency , something fear , but also , even the concentration of concentration , in the way , is a really difficult problem .
if you play , you see some of these , you see some of the orphans that are up to top of the body and the mouth of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player that &apos;s called a confrontation of a so-called confrontation .
oh , you know that . ok . so , we have some players here .
a result of victory is a result that is so strong that it &apos;s not before that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you reach it , they &apos;re shocked that they actually have to be able to do something like that . that &apos;s a kind of victory .
this player is a little bit of a snapshot of victory .
and this is what we have to see in millions of faces in the world , if we take the barriers of the next century in attack . the face of the world , the face of the census of a epic .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re going to see this face in real life when we &apos;re hard to meet problems .
i call it a lot of the &quot; in life , &quot; i &apos;m bad , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? ok ?
i &apos;m like i &apos;m going to do that in life , i &apos;m bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i was in my ph.d. , why we were in play better than in the real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not so good in reality as well as play .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , although that &apos;s what it &apos;s heard .
we &apos;re going to get more in the more . i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , to do something more sophisticated , to do something more sophisticated .
if we &apos;re in a computer , i think many of us are turning into our best version , anytime and immediately helpful , the problem to solve the problem , so long as necessary , it &apos;s going to try to try and try to try and try to try and try and try to try and try and try to try and try and try to try and try and try to try and try and try to try and try and try to try and try and try to try and try and try to try and
and in reality , if we &apos;re failing , if we &apos;re going to get to obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel interrupted . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or a little bit .
these feelings have never been , if we play games , there are just not .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a student .
why is it impossible to think of , you can &apos;t just do anything ?
how can we transmit these feelings from play in reality ?
so i looked like the world of warcraft , which provides the ideal environment to collaborative causes .
and i &apos;ve found some things that make the epic touch in the way .
so , first , if you get into one of these , especially in the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to be willing to get them a mission mission , and that &apos;s immediately .
but not only any mission , but a mission that fits perfect to your current level , right ?
so they do that .
they never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their skills , so they have to be involved in it , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around and it &apos;s a little bit more important . there &apos;s always a little bit important to do .
and there are a fever .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to end their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have this easy life in real life , that feeling that in a sense of a computer , that &apos;s a lot of a sheep &apos;s staff .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , these inspiring history , why we &apos;re there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve been aware of &quot; level up &quot; and &quot; + &quot; + a strength , or &quot; + &quot; + a intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in real life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have a talk , and i &apos;m not : + a minute , and a penny of a crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in the real life .
so , the problem of the world &apos;s problem is that it &apos;s so satisfying , at the edge of a epic , to stand in the edge of a epic .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of the world &apos;s world spent millions of years to solve the virtual problems of the world .
this is not necessarily something bad .
it may sound bad .
but to see it in context , the millions of years ago , our first favorite years started to go upright .
so the first one of the first agencies .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend with play , it &apos;s just a sense of when you &apos;re going to be in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also , it &apos;s also appropriate , because it turns out we use this whole time to play the whole time , actually , what we &apos;re able to do as humans in the situation .
we &apos;re developing to private health , thank you .
this is the truth . i think .
so , look at this interesting statistic , that recently was published by a researcher of carnegie mellon university : the average young man of today in a country with strong , 10,000 hours of the year of 50 to the 21st of 11 .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , they are the exact exact way that they spend in school , from the five grade to conclude , and when you never have to be missing .
so we have a complete kind of a whole , very much , on the young people , which means to be a good player , how everything you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have a new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of the most amazing research that if we spend 10,000 hours with the one of the most popular people in the 21st of a single subject to the 21st of 11 .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what &apos;s going on to do , as the most important people of the world .
so , what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are the most popular .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players going to be a good thing ? &quot;
because if we could figure out that , we would never have a lot of the potential human potential to it .
so many people have now in the world , which is at least an hour of a day with a day .
these are our most powerful ones . 500 million people who are extraordinary in &quot; something &quot; are &quot; something . &quot;
and the next decade we have another billion players that are extraordinary in what &apos;s always .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet , if you haven &apos;t heard it .
the most , the energy system , the energy , saving energy and work on the world , rather than the most , so that the player on the world , especially in india , china , brazil , can play online .
you expect a extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players in total .
so i started thinking about what it is to master that games .
here &apos;s the four things i found . first of all , the first thing .
ok , imagine how extreme the most extreme .
and the desire is to do something immediately , to master a barrier , and to be a glimpse of the belief that we have a conscious hope on success .
player always believe that a computer &apos;s victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth it , and it &apos;s going to be .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters of the spiders poet .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show people that we have to be playing after we &apos;ve played them , even if they were breaking us .
the reason that it is is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that someone spend time with us that the rules are going to be honored to be the same goal , and to the most remote to the most remote .
so the most important thing allows the most controlled to the ties of ties , trust and each other .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
and productivity productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the most of the most , of the most of the time of the age of 22 hours a week , is a kind of a day .
the reason is , if we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than if we relax or nothing .
we know that we &apos;re going to work as human beings , if we do hard , significant work .
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love it , part of awe of the way to be the same .
here &apos;s a computer , to go to the right light , and you know all wikipedia , the largest incremental world .
the second bollywood of the world , with almost 80,000 frames is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve been stored more information over the world of warcraft in the internet than any other subject in every other way .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to one single outcome . players are hopeful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is that they think they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the problem i try to solve .
edward &apos;s a kind of a computer system .
his work is great . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in the world .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to be a witnesses of not less than a of the oil in virtual worlds and the most remote . &quot;
and that &apos;s a economist . so he &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not as i ... i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit more .
so he says that actually makes sense , because players can achieve more than in the real life .
you can make more stronger social ties as in real life , and they get more feedback and rewards in play as in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s completely logical that players are more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not a more of the time .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from a event that 2,500 years of choosing .
there are these ancient cube , from the most of the time . you know ?
these fantastic most amazing things were there .
and that was kind of the first one of people developed .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the old greek , you may know that story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to the most devastating games , games were invented , more specifically , in the kingdom of a famine .
and there was such a big famine that the king of the king of the world was decided to be a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to the most , the most , the most , and the national strategy , and you would eat a national strategy , and you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the most profound , and they &apos;re so fascinating , and we &apos;re going to be in the world &apos;s own , and we &apos;re going to forget that it would forget that there were nothing to eat .
and then , the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to the most loud , they survived this famine for 18 years , and they were eating these famine by eating a day and played the next .
so , i think , let &apos;s sit in today .
we &apos;re putting games to get the suffering of the real world .
we &apos;re putting games to get everything to do that in the real world , not the real life , and we &apos;re going to get us out of what we need from play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
this is exciting .
according to 18 years , the famine was not better . so the king , a last , last , a last day .
they shared the kingdom in two camps .
they played a little bit of a sudden and the conclusion to be able to break a spear .
they left and they were looking at the search for a new home , and they just went back to the same way , like food , and they were looking for the rest of the rest of the way they could flourish .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest , the latest thing that the most recent , the most promising , the most promising , the same dna as the old dna .
so scientists recently came to the notion that the &quot; crazy story actually is true . &quot;
and geologists found evidence of a global cooling that took almost 20 years , which could explain famine .
so this crazy story might agree .
maybe you have saved your people through play by playing 18 years in games , and then they had this kind of thing and so much about the other of the things that they &apos;ve saved in this whole civilization .
so , we can also .
we &apos;ve been playing for 1994 in 1994 .
this was the first thing in real time in the world of the world &apos;s population . that was 16 years ago .
they played 18 years long , we &apos;ve been playing for 16 years of warcraft .
i &apos;m going to say we &apos;re ready for our own own game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i take my 21 billion a week .
we should be able to get a half of us to play a day with play a day , until we have solved the problems of real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of real world in play ? &quot; and that question i have in the last few years at the institute for the future .
we have this chief in our office in palo alto , and it &apos;s made out of how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best result . and then people are making this idea in reality .
we &apos;re going to take a epic touch and give people the possibilities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you very briefly three games that i designed to get people epic in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a kind of a , in which you have to overcome a computer .
the most , and we have invented , but we have enough , so it &apos;s going to be realistic for them and they actually live with the real life without oil . so , if you &apos;re going to get to play , you know , where are you going to be closed . and then you get to get them to be able to get a lot of oil , and then you &apos;re going to get to get it .
we tested this game with the systematic players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve accompanied them since the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a change .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure , and i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go from oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going to .
find out how they were going to survive . most of our players have been able to keep the behavior in the game .
so we have a bigger game for the next time , higher goal than just a more , higher goal .
we have the game &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the calculation is the calculation of a computer that people have only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global &quot; system , of course .
the call on players , we have a very , very like &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you know jerry &apos;s , where there &apos;s the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in our game , instead of just five people say , every one is in the most remote , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , security , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game eight weeks long .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they &apos;re &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the last game is , we &apos;re going to go out at the third of march . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the world bank , the award of social health , in 2010 .
we work with universities in sub-saharan africa and store them , to learn social degradation .
we have a comic comic . we have to understand the level of the level of the world , and we have to understand , sustainability , vision , vision and ingenuity .
i want to invite you to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in the world , which benefit to the world , to save their own social enterprise to save the world .
i &apos;m going to go to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what , do you think , next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope you agree in this , that players are human resources that we can use in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have this whole presidential presidential productivity , the ability to make the ability to make close social nets , and the desire to make sense of the meaning of the meaning .
i really hope we &apos;re going to play great games to survive on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design with me like this and play .
if i was in the next decade , i &apos;m sure i &apos;m sure that we can create every basic future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start playing the world games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about what i &apos;ve been talking about a few months ago in a few months ago .
i &apos;ve always got my favorite , but i was working with the end of the text , and i fell on the end of the text , and i fell on my life , which is the word &quot; disabled &quot; really .
i read you the post .
&quot; disabled , , &quot; i &apos;m going to be , &quot; the &quot; , &quot; the helpless , hopeful , destroyed , tweet , uh-huh , uh-huh , uh-huh , talented , mentally , and , i &apos;m going to get , failed , and i was getting , slowly , copied , slowly , slowly , slowly , slowly , slowly , slowly , slowly , slowly , copied , slowly , slowly , slowly , slowly , slowly , slowly , slowly , copied , slowly , slowly , slowly , slowly , slowly , slowly ,
and the healthy thing : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
i read this list of a friend , and i had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i was just going to be , and i was just going to stop to read and i had to go to that kind of thing and i had to go to this kind of thing and i was going to get to the emotional shock and the emotional shock .
of course , this was a kind of a , old , old , and i just thought that the copy has to be quite old .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early 1980s when i started with school and started with my self , and to form my self outside of my family , and to form in other kids and the rest of the world around me .
and god is very much used to me at the time .
i would take a look seriously , i would be born in a world that someone like me would perceive as a person who could be able to go in any way . but i &apos;m going to be able to be celebrated for the opportunity and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately have the most of the time of 2009 , and i expected that i find a little bit of a contribution .
here &apos;s the most the version of this kind of thing .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
and in particular , the last two words are under &quot; close &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and people around us .
many of the memes , including the greeks and the roman , have really believed that the long-lived one is a big force , because that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing loud , also , and the thing you can do is , also , the way that you can do it .
so what do we want to do -- a detailed person or a powerful person ?
and a person &apos;s being a child , as a child , could be able to be able to be able to do it and you &apos;re going to have ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open your doors ?
a human being that opened for me was my pediatrician at the most devastating institute in the world &apos;s own .
he &apos;s called dr. &apos;s favorite . a computer , whose name , as you can think , is the most american , and so he was always called dr. territory .
and dr. wingspan always wore very colorful and was just making a lot of kids like created .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my favorite .
i had to be able to get an infinite deal with these massive , horror , a decent , a lot of colors -- you know , to build my favorite , and i hated this flying down . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
and imagine , i even have a child &apos;s child with dr. wingspan , and so trying to stop this practice , without success .
and one day he saw me at one of my work -- this practice was just tiring and praying -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;ll get one day .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
and that was just a simple trick of dr. depths , so i &apos;m doing the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the way that richest five girls in the hospital are going to be in the second stick . but he actually got me to see my daily eyes .
and i &apos;m asking myself how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl has shaped my self and i could imagine as a natural , powerful and a half of the people .
this is just an example of many , like adults in the world &apos;s imagination , and the imagination of a child can do .
but as the already of the most , examples of the most remote , we can &apos;t prove our language , to imagine what we would all wish , and we would all ask ourselves to allow each other to be more than powerful people .
our language is the social changes that has been caused in many cases of a technological change .
and the medical standpoint of view can tell you that my legs , the most , the most , for the most , is from titan , and artificial health , which allows people to use their own own own own own own own , and they &apos;re not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get their own destiny out of the world .
so maybe this technological change is clear because it &apos;s always a different truth , which is that every person of society is something that can be a very powerful and powerful , and that human ability to adapt to our biggest plus .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me how to do with the achievements and i &apos;m going to say something like that , and i &apos;ve always felt that i &apos;m going to feel like , and i think , i think , and i think , i think , and i think , i think , and i think , i think , and i think , i think , and i think , i think , and i think , i think , and i
this sentence of the idea of the brain lives with the idea that success or happiness depends on being a challenge without being able to be connected to the experience of the life , and as well as people are going to be able to get me to a prosthetic , or whatever people are going to do with my disability .
but the truth is that we change ourselves . of course we &apos;re defined by the challenge , whether they &apos;re physically , emotionally or even both of them is both .
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s good .
achievements are not obstacle that we need to be able to get to our lives better .
achievements are just to our lives .
and i tend to see the achievements as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s not to see , but he &apos;s constantly at me .
and i don &apos;t want to do the impact , or the heavy of a human being .
there are the achievements in life and challenges , and these are just the real real and every person &apos;s real way to do it , but the question is not if we come to the achievements or not , but how we get it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for people that we love to preserve , but they also prepare to get good with it .
and we don &apos;t have to be able to do our kids if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to separate two things , to be a medical fact , to be a medical fact , and to the other social opinion , whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and more basic disability that i had to put apart is that the world is constantly going to be , you could describe me with these definitions .
in our desire , people who are to protect us , and they &apos;re the cold , hard truth about their medical prediction or even a prediction to the quality of life that they expect to be able to do .
maybe this is the concept of the concept that just watch what &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we fix that , for every single one of the things than the food rates .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being , and not all his forces and possibilities , we can see in addition to the natural struggle that you might have to do , another disease .
we &apos;re a human being , which has a value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the most of the world &apos;s most , and we &apos;re going to focus on all the area of human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between the perception of our psyche and our great most amazing .
we shouldn &apos;t get this challenging times , or we should not be able to get to the way , we should not try to avoid them , we should be able to go to the carpet , but it &apos;s about seeing the achievements of opportunity .
and maybe it &apos;s more about asking that we don &apos;t have to get the achievements to get it to the way that we &apos;re going to hug it , you &apos;re going to hug it , and maybe to break it up to the face of a car , and maybe dance .
and maybe we can do it , the achievements as something natural , harmful and useful and feeling so much of us , and you don &apos;t feel like that .
in this year , we celebrate 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote over 150 years ago , darwin has written in my eyes , darwin , in my eyes , in a very true human character .
i would be so so so ashamed : not the most powerful of his kind , and not the most powerful of his way , but the ones that can adapt to the best .
from conflicts , creativity is creativity .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people to survive and the fight of the human mind is to transform through conflict .
so again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of people .
and maybe we know what wood is we &apos;re going to cut out when we &apos;re really testing .
maybe that &apos;s the sense of the achievements , a perception of the report , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like that .
we can give a new meaning to the other time that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see the achievements as change .
achievements are for a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve been making ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
so , frankly , who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical . but not the normal . and would you really know these poor , gray person really want to learn if it really gave you ?
i think more , not .
it would be great if we &apos;re the normal of the normal , and the strength to even make it a little dangerous , exchange , and so we can interpret the forces of very many children , and they invite them to put their very special and valuable skills in society .
and the fact is , we found people from the members of our society , and to be useful , to be useful and to afford a contribution .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals have 60,000 years old , and people with heavy physical injuries , and that might be , because the life life in the world &apos;s life was valuable for society .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as a little bit more useful and valuable .
a few years ago , i went in the city where i grew up in a new school in this red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood there a little bit of a sudden .
it was summer and i had a lot of the time .
and i hear how a guy says behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee . &quot;
and i &apos;m moving to this , and i see these older man . i didn &apos;t know who he &apos;s .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you &apos;re not going to remember me .
when i first saw them , i brought them out of your mother . &quot;
oh , so that .
and of course , it &apos;s made it click .
that was dr. &apos;s , a man i just knew from narratives of my mother about this day because i knew , of course , a typical , typical , to my birthday two weeks .
the doctor for the computer of my mother was in vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without a , and my feet had been in the way to give you a few toes and i just had a few toes on this and a few toes on the other foot .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say your parents , you never would go , and never be like that , and never be a independent life , and you &apos;ve never been able to lie in a independent life since you &apos;re just lying . &quot;
and i really found that he had collected my entire childhood , whether i won in a second class in the second grade , whether i had to get to the most remote , and he was using these clips to teach his students , and he used this clips to teach his students , and he used this clips , and he used this clips , and he used this clips , and he used this clips , and he used to get this clips , and he used to get this clips , and he used to get
and he called this part of his course , the x factor , the potential of human being .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough , as critical as the problem of a human being .
and dr. , and dr. , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they don &apos;t always get something else , and even if they get a little bit of support , they can get children very much . &quot;
see , dr. &apos;s , i think , has changed .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone is dealing with it , two different things .
and i &apos;ve changed my thinking in the run of time when they asked me to ask me if i had a dozen of the legs , if i had my prostheses against legs and bones , i wouldn &apos;t have a second .
i was really going to be normal at the time .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not sure .
and that &apos;s what happens because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not despite this experience .
and maybe this change could happen because i &apos;ve been able to have a lot of people that have opened doors , rather than to meet people who were drawn me or a idea .
look , it really takes a human being , which shows you how you can get your forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate your own , inner forces , the human mind is so much -- if you create that , and for someone in a critical moment , they &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to open up the doors .
the real meaning of the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means something that is in one is that the potential is the potential .
again , what potential is we going to be going to be now ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the &apos; 60s , a case was done in the u.k. , and then the most of the time in the &apos; 60s was transformed .
they call this &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the students are divided to grades .
and the a student will be more optimistic , getting the better teachers , etc .
they have been given a very , very , a period of time students with a &quot; enough &quot; , &quot; very good . &quot; it was told you , they were very smart , and after these three months , they really wrote .
and of course , it breaks a heart to hear that the opposite was told the most important thing was , they &apos;re just enough .
and then it was then the three months .
but only those who were still in school -- except from the students who were drawn to school .
and the key thing about this study was that the teachers were not the most important .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
you just said that the students and that are the students who are enough , and they &apos;ve taught them something and they &apos;re treated .
the only thing is a broken mind is a conscious mind , which was broken , has no more hope . he doesn &apos;t find it more than the natural , a little bit more , and our innocence of imagination .
but if we do it , the human mind is to support the human mind , and to hope , even and other people around themselves , and then we &apos;re going to put our forces really positive .
if a mind has a mind about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new new health .
i want to end with a poem that was written by a necrophilia poet called the 14th poet , and i told my friend of jacques , and the poem is called &quot; the god , &quot; not the god , and he &apos;s just going to say , &quot; well , i &apos;m just going to know , dance , not the god , &quot; not the god &apos;s words , and he &apos;s always going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to know , &quot; i &apos;m just going to say , &quot; don &apos;t know ,
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right now ?
suppose i said , through a few changes of their genes , a better memory could have -- more accurate , more accurate and faster .
or you want to be more powerful , stronger , more power .
do you want to be more attractive and more more frequently ?
how would it be to live longer in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who are always dreaming of creativity .
what would you like to do most ?
what would you like to have if you could have one ?
creativity .
how many people would creativity choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about so many as it &apos;s creative people here .
this is very good .
how many would be prepared for a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to do the most , as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is that all the fantasy ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a compelling topic here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you a doctor &apos;s view of a doctor .
the big geneticists in the 20th century , the most , also , was a more of the russian church in the russian , once , once , wrote a paper , with the title of nothing in biology . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time , you &apos;re going to take your personal -- and maybe you can take a look at the permission , and maybe you can take a look at kathryn &apos;s pants , and maybe you can take a look at kathryn .
but if you accept biological evolution , you think about this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for other people &apos;s disease or it &apos;s also ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
in this picture , i have a bush as a center of the branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of life , all the existing species of the branches have been successful , they &apos;ve survived it .
the human part of this kind of thing , far on the end , is that what we &apos;re most interested in is that most of us are interested in most .
we &apos;re going to get a common ancestor from a shared ancestor about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , there may be 20 or 25 different kinds of species of hominids .
some are come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about the most of the time .
it seems like we &apos;re right from the other parts of the tree , but actually , the biggest part , are the fundamental mechanisms our cells are pretty equal to the cells .
is you clear that we can use it and can make the mechanisms of a shared bacterium to produce the protein of the human being , which is used to treat the brain ?
this is not like a kind of thing ; this is the same protein that &apos;s the same protein of what comes from the pancreas .
and what &apos;s about bacteria talking about bacteria is that every one of us in our gut is more bacteria than the cells in our body ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , do you think if antonio &apos;s , &quot; you know , if antonio &apos;s . &quot;
our gut is a wonderful environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s a little bit more comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to all give you nutrients that you might just want to offer without effort .
it &apos;s really a easier way to bacteria , with a very sophisticated tank of unintended , and the most devastating .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they &apos;re important for their lives .
they help the raise nutrients . and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary balance in the form of a species ?
or are we going to be a little bit more -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
now , let &apos;s go back to the time of the big bang in 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago -- the first signs of living organisms , maybe the first thing that &apos;s going on in the planet , and then the human species , which is the first thing that &apos;s going on in the planet .
in this huge literal symphony of the universe , life is just just just a second ; the animal kingdom , like a single one , and the human life , a small one .
that was we .
this is also the most important thing that &apos;s going on , so i hope , d , it &apos;s like you .
now , when i was a computer on college , i had my first favorite project .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with evolution , and i asked something very fundamental : in most the existence of life in the world , every cell , and all the genetic information is going to be led to both the new information .
but at the time , as a while , organisms came out to change things .
sexual reproduction is going to the picture .
and very important , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , that &apos;s the genome of the body , the rest of the body is going to be the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the most of the death of death in the same moment is going to go in the same moment as the sexual reproduction .
now i have to say , if i was a computer , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable to be a little bit of the time , but with every year , it &apos;s been completely reasonable to my own , but with every year , it &apos;s been completely reasonable .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , who read his show in las vegas .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his own .
he opens the door .
he &apos;s a beautiful high school of the day .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for a computer . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; george , &quot; i &apos;ll take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization as a doctor that i was a goal to the relationship of evolution , not necessarily , just a lot of the evolution .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to hold healthy .
i wanted to create the health for a disease .
i wanted to do that we &apos;re going to have a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the creation of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they &apos;re and i developed as a lot of rockets to send the genetic health system into the next stage of orbit to go to the sea .
i think we would all be the mood that was given the caregiver of all the term , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want immortality to achieve my work .
i want to get it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily be the biggest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution is the creatures that are best on their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
and the bottom of the ocean is bacteria , the most powerful , and that &apos;s the hot pest , otherwise , if fish were there , they would have a vacuum to be a little bit more than the time .
so , what does that mean when we look back at what happens in evolution , and how we think about the space of the human evolution , and especially as we &apos;re going to go to the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
the first is we &apos;re not going to move .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reason that we were , the reason that we were first is to get a lot of genes that would be otherwise , and it was been made out of the population .
and secondly , we have a species of our environment that we &apos;ve done it , that they &apos;ve been able to adapt to us and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and mix and mix and mix so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary to be able to do it for evolution .
a second possibility is that it will be a evolution of traditional species , of course , of course , of nature .
and the argument , here would be the wheels of evolution slowly , but they &apos;re wet .
and so far the isolation is going to be removed when we &apos;re going to go away as a species , it will be donated and give the change of the environment that could produce evolution on natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a compelling , fascinating and scary opportunity .
i call it a lot of the new development that &apos;s not just , but it &apos;s led to us as a more of us in the decisions that we do .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s first look at the reality that people today are making decisions about their offspring .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family is deciding .
so think of it if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to make genetic mistrust , the disease , and prevent the disease .
what if you could make the genetic changes to get diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or transplant the treatment of the treatment or ski ?
would you not want to do this , to make these changes in your genes ?
if we &apos;re going to be more likely to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do this kind of change .
the human genome project started in 1990 and it took 13 years .
it costs a lot of dollars .
in the next year , when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same for 20 million dollars in the world .
today , you can have a sequence of three billion base base of the human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 and in the room of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take long to be the reality , and it will be the 1,000 dollars of human genome , and it will be more available for everyone .
a week , the national academy of engineering , the national academy of engineering , is the most powerful prize for francis arnold and the two scientists that were threatened by the natural process of evolution , and to make a more efficient way to work .
a few years ago , the most recent one was given the scientists to be able to be able to put a adult for his research in the he was a adult , a more , a , and through the manipulation of only four genes that are the cell .
these changes are in the coming .
the same technology that can make the human insulin into bacteria can &apos;t only make viruses , but also to the receiver against other viruses .
whether they believe it or not , it &apos;s a experimental study in the gang with immunization in the cells of a computer system .
can you imagine something good that comes from tobacco ?
this is all reality today and in the future , and it &apos;s going to be much more possible .
so imagine just two other changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of their descendants ?
what if you could change the teenage and the fresh egg or the fresh egg to give your children a better chance to give you a better chance of diabetes -- the diabetes , the risk of cancer ?
who don &apos;t want to get sick kids ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science that can allow change to prevent disease , could also allow us to optimize the better memory , the better memory .
why don &apos;t the most remote of a ken of a ken is , especially if you can extend it with the next generation of the world &apos;s next generation ?
why not have the fast of the fast , which will allow you to walk faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are going to be the most powerful .
and if we &apos;re on a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can optimize the attributes that we want to be transformed by the evolution of evolution .
we will have a process that requires 100,000 years , and we can be able to block it on a thousand years -- and maybe the next 100 years .
these are decisions with their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , they need to be able to be .
do we use these decisions to form a society that is better , which is more important ?
or will we choose different attributes that we want to have for some of us , and not for other people ?
will we form a society , and is it more powerful , or more robust and more robust ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to see .
and the most deepest thing , we ever will be able to develop wisdom , and the wisdom that we need to make that decisions are going to be to make this decisions ?
in the good way , and as you might think , these decisions are going to be us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something that gives you a portable robot , which gives you a lot of skills , or another , the most , the most , back to the top , and go to go .
we call this robot to berkeley , and we call these robots .
they &apos;re not a little bit more than something you put in the morning and gives you extra strength and increase that , for example , to keep your balance .
that &apos;s actually the true thing that &apos;s actually the true thing of human and machine .
but not just that -- so they &apos;re going to connect and connect to the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers , who &apos;s in average about 100 pounds on his back and it &apos;s the request that they should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- the most important , 30 percent of it -- chronic , chronic .
so we thought we would take this challenge to take us and create a kind of a system that would help that problem to deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to you now -- or the human general is more universal .
soldier : with the most of the time , i can wear 200 pounds of the terrain , many hours long .
his flexible design allows it to be deep to the place , to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do very insecure movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and increase my strength and resilience .
we &apos;re so far to imagine our favorite system , this new kind of new school system in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s look at our view of the brain , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people in the world , sitting in the wheelchair .
this is about a percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually an conservative estimate .
we often talk about very young people with spinal cord , which is in the lower of their life -- &apos; 20s , &apos; 80s , &apos; 80s , and the wheelchair was the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , which is the number of people .
and so the only option -- if it comes to a more , or to other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so it has been since 500 years , since his , as i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in the area .
so let me introduce you to you , which is a hurricane of amanda , who was wearing a spinal cord , which has been the result that they couldn &apos;t run for 19 years and until now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our favorite .
it has sensors -- it has sensors -- it has sensors -- it has sensors .
his completely , very , sensors in crutches , the signals of the signals , the signals that are on their back .
here &apos;s also a lot of the time that &apos;s the most , the most , the most , also , like your own , and you &apos;re moving forward to the very natural and very natural cad .
i was 24 years old , and in the southern school , as a computer of a computer , i was a more of a sudden .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every sense and every movement below my own .
not long after the time , a doctor in my hospital hospital and he said , &quot; amanda , you can never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s steel every single day of my consciousness .
reliable technologies have been able to learn to learn , to go back , to go back , to climb and drive the hands .
but nothing was invented to me , and i would go back to that .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to make us meet and discuss them .
it &apos;s in our hands and we have the whole potential to change life from future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for amanda here , but for all the things .
thank you .
in new york , i &apos;m a head of the world &apos;s head of a nonprofit organization called robin fischeri .
if i don &apos;t get the poverty , i &apos;m like a computer of a computer of a volunteer in a volunteer .
now , in our city , in the volunteers , the volunteers have to be supported by a very early , very early thing to be able to be able to do .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer on the world &apos;s second , so i had quite good opportunities to be able to do .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to get the adoption of the adoption and find what our tasks would be .
when i found the most serious , he was just in a very serious conversation with the most serious days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she was in the 50th and barefoot , and the barefoot rain outside of a screen in the water .
the other volunteers that came up with me was -- let &apos;s call it a masterpiece of the spanish luther -- the first one was the first and asked to save the dog of the world &apos;s house .
the dog ! i was a lost .
there was some lawyer or a half , which is now for the rest of his life , people told that he went to a living house to save a living living , because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next .
the most of the time to me .
he said , &quot; ezra , you have to go in the house .
they have to go up to the fire , and they have to get a few shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
now , not exactly what i hoped , but i went -- the stairs up , the hallway along , the hallway , the real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real &quot; is to get a few shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey back to the bottom , where i met my favorite and the beloved dog .
we put our concerns out to the outside , where , not surprisingly , his much more attention than my .
some weeks later , the most weeks , the most famous one letter , the letter of the most brave , in which she &apos;s going to be the brave use of your house .
one of all of them are more powerful kindness : somebody had a few shoes .
both in my profession at robin graham as well as a volunteer fireman , i &apos;m witness by generosity and kindness in the great scale , but i also see the charity and the most of the time .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look at this room , and people see that either a more of the time , or on their way , i want to offer a memory , i don &apos;t want to offer you .
don &apos;t wait to do a difference in life , until you &apos;ve reached your first million .
if you give something to give you a little bit , you &apos;re going to give it .
they &apos;re using a park in a computer industry , rooms .
be a mentor .
not everybody &apos;s going to offer us a chance to save life , but every day , the possibility of the possibility is to change one .
so they put it up ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno &apos;s : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just come back from a community that knows the secret of humanity &apos;s secret .
a place where women lead the most , with sex , and the game is going to say , and the game is determined -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not a lot of the way you &apos;re or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their unconscious .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the forest of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees , our next living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , which lived about six million years ago .
well chimpanzees are known for their own .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of the human evolution in the human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the mola .
while chimpanzees of great , fear of great , fear of the most , is led to the most of the time .
and that &apos;s actually what came up , because that leads to a very much more powerful society in the deadly violence .
but unfortunately bonobos are least known under the primates .
they live in the deep of the overall of the overall , and they &apos;re just hard to make the observation available .
the congo is a paradox -- a country extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the scene of a violent argument that has been used for decades of the first world war .
it &apos;s not surprising that these destruction also survive the survival of bonobos .
and the decline of the world &apos;s decline is that you can &apos;t even fill a demo with the remaining bonobos -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country , in this country , you can hear a little laugh , that the trees are delighted .
who are these related ?
we know , as &quot; love , &quot; and you know , &quot; love , &quot; because they have a finite , also , with the partner , and the rules , and the rules of the conflict .
i &apos;m not saying that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because life is from the bonobos of the bonobos .
bonobos -- how people -- love to play their lives long .
play doesn &apos;t just mean it .
for us , it &apos;s essential to the attachment of relationships and care of tolerance .
we learn to trust and the rules of the game .
play creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the production of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you watch bonobos at the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human being , dance and rituals .
play is the most remote thing that we &apos;re doing .
well , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you some unique footage straight from the wild .
first of all , a computer on the world -- and i don &apos;t think about football .
so here we see a young female and males in a computer .
look at what you do .
that could be the evolutionary origin : &quot; you put it on the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more like him , right .
yes !
so , the most common thing is spread , both in bonobos as well as people .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- and this video is really interesting because it shows the most interesting thing to play with the game that you &apos;re going to do -- as the allosphere -- and also , as it &apos;s a lot of trust , as it &apos;s going to be made .
but the game is a kind of a more , a lot of a time .
play is a kind of a lot of forms and it can take many forms of that some of these are a little bit shorter , and maybe to discover the surprise .
and i want to show you that this is a young female , a young female , and she plays peaceful with water .
i think exactly how you play , we sometimes get to the way , and we &apos;re going to be in the limits of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us research , and interact with it . and the unexpected internet that we form , are the real base of creativity .
this is just a little taste on the insights that bonobos are giving us in our past and present .
but it &apos;s true for our future , a future , which we need to adapt to increasing challenges , through larger creativity and the most more of cooperation .
the secret is that the game of the key to these skills is .
with other words , play is our favorite .
to adapt to a world &apos;s world , we need to play .
but will we do the best from our own system ?
play is not silly , isn &apos;t silly .
but essential .
for bonobos and people equally , life is not out of teeth and claws alone .
just if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , it may be the game .
and so , my favorite , let &apos;s hug this gift of evolution , and in common , while we &apos;re doing creativity , the most important thing .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couples , in 1979 , at the same time , in the same moment , every one of the time , every one baby -- okay .
so two couples , every one of the reasons .
now i don &apos;t want you to imagine that they &apos;re going to be able to imagine the spelling , because if they &apos;re all the time , they don &apos;t listen to me .
imagine that just for a moment .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case , the alfred is wearing y , which is the x chromosome of the most profound chromosome .
and in the other case , the horror is a x chromosome , which is the x chromosome of the most profound chromosome .
both are the most powerful ones , both shining .
we &apos;re going to come back to these people .
in most of my activities , i have two minds .
and i &apos;m going to do that under a hat of anatomy .
i &apos;m studied historian , and i study that , as people with anatomy -- that human body , animal bodies -- how they thought about body data , like the body .
the other hat i was wearing in my work is the activist , as a while , or , as i say , as a prosthetic lawyer -- from people who are patients from doctors .
in this case , i worked with people who have the most important norms in question .
so , for example , i worked with people who are the most popular twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with a lot of people -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often , i &apos;ve worked with people who are the gender of the gender -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female .
and as a general term , we can use the word of the word .
and in many different forms , in many different forms .
i just give you a few examples of the possible guys who don &apos;t have the male or female standard .
in a case , you may have somebody with a computer of a computer , and the most the gene &apos;s gene is called the most , the most remote thing we have to grow up .
and that &apos;s why the testicles are going to be in the middle stage of testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to recognize testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and that &apos;s called a lot of the things .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as a consequence , the body has more than the typical female of the time .
if the child is born , it looks like a girl .
it &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s brought up as a girl .
but it &apos;s mostly going to take puberty , and they grow their breasts and develop their breasts , but they don &apos;t get their period to get a little different .
and they &apos;re doing some tests and find out that instead of the other , they &apos;re actually carrying a lot of the time and the uterus , actually , and they &apos;re carrying a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold this person for the male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , as men , have something called the body that you call it .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the most , the most little bit of the time , are the ones that are the microscopic hormones .
most women , as i -- i think , is to be a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual favorite , but i think i &apos;m probably going to have the typical -- most women like me are actually talking to you .
we produce the most remote and we &apos;re talking to a soundscape .
the consequence is that someone like me actually has a brain that was exposed to more than a woman who was born with testicles , and a more of the time has been done .
so gender is really complicated ; they &apos;re not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be distributed across the whole range , you can be distributed across the whole range .
one example ago , a few years ago , i got the call of a 19 man , who was born as a young boy , when young was raised , he had a friend , had sex , and he had just found that he had a banana and he had a blender .
he had an extreme form of a natural form of a natural design .
he has a lot of the chromosome , and in the womb , his favorite , were so strong that they have created a male in the essence of a male .
and as a consequence , his husband was holding male male , his brain was exposed to the male male part of the world &apos;s .
and when he was born , he saw how a boy was -- nobody had something .
and only as he became 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he was inside the inside of the world that the doctors were found that he was inside female .
okay , just a quick example of a recent example of a dollar .
some people with the chromosomes , develop something that is called the most , is called the most of the time of the world &apos;s .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so gender can be in many different varieties .
the reason kids with this kind of body -- it &apos;s a lot of the body , or the main twins , it &apos;s a lot of the norm -- from surgeons often are adapted to the norm , because this is not because this is for your physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason to do that is , in some ways , the other way of being trained to be the way that they threaten our social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that a certain amount of solid scales with a certain identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is going to be a female identity ; a black person is going to be , is , to have an african anatomy in terms of the own story .
so we have this awful vivid idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body that actually is a very different thing , that &apos;s confused in terms of these things .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about the spears .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of the spears .
now you can imagine how amazing it is , when kids are born , the two people are in a body .
where i &apos;ve been experienced most of the excitement of the most exciting , the south american was the south of the last year whose gender was asked in the world &apos;s world in berlin .
many journalists called me , with the question : &quot; what are you going to do , who tells us whether the most important thing is , &quot; whether the most male is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s no test that there &apos;s no test .
so we know that gender is complicated enough that we need to admit that nature is not for us , and the female , or between male and female and female and female and female and the female , are we &apos;re doing it as of course .
so we have a situation where the further our science is expanding , we need to tell us that these categories , that we had been given for stable amounts of categories , which made very simple , much better than we &apos;ve imagined .
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also about race , which turns out as much more complicated than our most complicated .
we &apos;re in our dimensions of the way we &apos;re in all kinds of things .
we &apos;re going to go to the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we going to start with the fact that we &apos;re just different from them to be different by a few year-olds ?
while we continue to move our science further , we get increasingly in a zone of the manual , where we have to recognize that the most simple categories we had probably had to be too simple .
we see that in all kinds of areas of human life .
one of the areas that we see in the world is in our culture today , in the united states today , the fight of the beginning , and the end of life .
we have hard conversations about what the point is a body to people , so he &apos;s got another right than the most devastating life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about the question , when someone is dead .
our ancestors used to be so hard to fight with the question when someone was dead .
they &apos;ve been given a feather under the nose , and if they moved , they don &apos;t buried them yet .
if you don &apos;t moved to it , you &apos;ve buried them .
but today we are in a situation where we take people accountable organs and they want to put other people in the way .
and as a result , we &apos;re going to be in the fight with the really difficult question , when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have so simple categories .
now you might think that the whole crash is going to be a very bold accident of the categories of the research .
i &apos;m politically politically profitable , i &apos;m going to be able to get people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit it &apos;s nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , i think , make me a convincing .
and it makes me a convincing thing to do in terms of democracy .
so to tell you about this tension , i have to take a big fan of the fathers .
i know you were a little bit of the time , i know you were a lot of the time , but they were great .
i think they were so much so much , and so radical , and so radical , which they were doing , i &apos;m all looking at the most few years of the most years , and it &apos;s not because of music , which is absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s going on to the most of the time .
the fathers were made of my view of the original activists , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so much .
what they were doing was a very a concept of a concept , and they were feeding it through another , which was radical and beautiful for us .
as you all remember , our fathers , the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy is taken in the reason in a very supportive concept of anatomy .
the operator of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of the world &apos;s .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power , and that political power should have been , because of the the father , the father &apos;s son , and so on .
the fathers of the idea of the idea , and they were feeding them through a new amount of concept , and this concept said that all people were designing the same thing .
they &apos;re the field of the field and decided that that &apos;s the common thing that the common thing is , not the differences . and that was very radical .
now they did that , because they were part of a system , in which two things were together in common .
democracy grew up , but the same time was growing up the science .
if you look at the story of the fathers , it &apos;s clear that many of you were interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a world &apos;s world .
they went away from explanations , and they were things like a spontaneous concept of power , back where the transmission on a very sophisticated concept is based on the tunisian .
they moved to a more of the time .
and if you look at the independence , you talk about nature and god &apos;s god .
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature .
they &apos;re talking about nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they were going to be a concept of the connected common common .
and so they &apos;re really afraid of the future civil rights .
they don &apos;t think about it , but what they &apos;ve done for us was great .
so what happened for years ?
for example , women , the most little , the concept of the fathers , that says that massive more sophisticated is more important than the vast difference , and said , &quot; we don &apos;t have the back of the way that we don &apos;t have the end of the way that we don &apos;t have the end of the , etc . , etc . &quot;
and women are successful .
next , the successful civil rights , where we saw people like the most people , how do i have a woman who &apos;s about the way that i was doing it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the world &apos;s most remote rows , which say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people different skin skin , which is in a huge amount of common differences , again , successful differences .
we see the same thing in the world &apos;s same .
of course , the problem is that , and we start looking at all the similarities , we need to start asking , why we &apos;re going to eliminate certain people .
well , mind , i want to sustain certain ponds , and we saw a lot of the time in our culture .
i want to be a fish for example , for example , a fish like a human being .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that the little little , you should have the right to sex , or to marry your consent .
so there are some huge ponds that make sense to me , and we think i should keep thinking .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep it , and whether they &apos;re feeling .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that have been the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in 1979 at the same time .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , three months , was born , so she &apos;s born at june 1980 .
mr. , on the other side , will be born in the one of the time , so he &apos;s born at march 1980 .
only because of the fact that maria was born three months of the fact , they all get a different rights of three months ago -- the right sex sex , which is right to drink the right .
mr. must wait for all this , not because he actually has another biological age , only because of the most of his birth .
we &apos;re still finding other people &apos;s rights .
mr. , because you take a male , it &apos;s male -- although i don &apos;t say that he &apos;s the most of the time that he &apos;s going to be male , you can get male , he &apos;s going to get to be a male .
maria , you can &apos;t see the same thing in all states , which has been the same thing that &apos;s got to be in all states , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
mr. , in every state , can marry a woman , but maria can only marry a woman today .
so we have this permanent parallel survey that are problematic in many ways and excess .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is doing this progress in the pacific of anatomy that we have to be able to admit that a democracy that is based on anatomy , could be a democracy that &apos;s based on anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to give you science , but it feels like the science is going to make it free .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture is going to take a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; well , we need to pull somewhere , so we &apos;re going to pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people are in a very strange position .
so for example , texas has decided to marry a man that means to marry a man that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and a woman means that you have a y chromosome .
now , in practice , people are not tested on their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i told you about the most remote .
if we look at one of the fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king offers us in his &quot; i have a dream of saying , &quot; a kind of solution .
he says we shouldn &apos;t be people for &quot; their skin skin , &quot; but after the property of their character , &quot; judge , &quot; and it goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you judge people because of their characters ?
i want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be able to give right in terms of people , because i have to admit that i know a series of golden water that i know .
i want to know that i probably know some bright , and i &apos;m probably familiar with some bright , smart and more powerful decisions about their sexual relationships than some of the things i know .
so how should we be the question for the characteristics of character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really hard .
and one part of me asks , what if the content would be something that would be in the future -- using an fmri visible ?
do we really want to go into this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is going to be able to make care of democracy .
in our success , we have done our thing right , and i think we would make our thing good in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like it &apos;s in iran , where a man who feels sexually to other men , with death , is being engaged , because it &apos;s ready to put a lot of the life in which case he &apos;s going to stay alive .
states of this kind of way exist in us .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon i talked about a few years ago , which had a few of the things that had a few of the things to separate , partly to separate a name .
but when i was with him , and he asked him why he made these surgeries -- it was high surgeries -- was his answer to the country , that children would be very bad , and that &apos;s why he had to do it .
i said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve got political models in the pursuit of a surgery instead of separate them ? &quot;
the united states offer incredible opportunities to allow people to be the ones that they &apos;re not to change the state of the state .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to conclude , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked very much about dads .
and i want to think about the possibilities like democracy , or looked at the way we could have the mothers more involved .
and i want to say something that is radical for a feminist , and i think that there could be different kinds of insights that are going to be done by different kinds of anatomy , if people apply a more of the way .
since years , because i was interested in the most , i &apos;ve been interested in research in the field of the world &apos;s area .
and one of the things i really found is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from the research studies is that women , in average -- not every , but in average -- rather complex social relationships and the care of people who are in the group of people who are vulnerable to the group of attention .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i made college college , i asked myself one of my graduate students , who knew my interest on feminism -- i looked like a feminist , so it &apos;s a really kind of a really a really a really a really powerful question .
he said , &quot; tell me what on feminism is female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the most the question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about gender stereotypes , so that &apos;s why feminism is not female .
but the more i thought about his question , to thought that i could give you a little female in feminism .
that &apos;s what it should be called , it could give something in average , which is the female brains of male , which makes us close to a lot of social relationships , and to worry about the most remote thing for the most remote .
so where the fathers were extremely supportive of finding how individuals could be protected by the state , it &apos;s possible that if we &apos;re more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re more likely to protect it , but how we can protect each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we &apos;re going to go to the future when we &apos;re going to be democracy , and we think about the individual body , and to think about the individual body , and more about relationships .
so , when we try to make a more perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a lot of a suitcase and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got in this , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with the leaks .
i love to see a different kind of opportunity to find a different thing , crazy , crazy , and in the last time , and to photograph .
but i don &apos;t buy new .
i get all my clothes from second hand on the long hand , and in the southern school .
ooh , thank you .
and i &apos;m allowed to reduce the impact of my favorite , and also the impact of my wallet .
i meet all sorts of great people ; my dollar is usually a good purpose ; i see pretty unique ; and it &apos;s going to go to my very personal personal .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it have my size ?
will i like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i &apos;ve got for this exciting week in ted .
i mean , what does someone bring with so many of the dating dating ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven some legs , and that &apos;s all .
and the one week for exactly a week is all i did in my suitcase .
i have a bet that i would be able to wear everything i would wear , if i was going to get to palm springs .
and they don &apos;t have heard about me as the woman who &apos;s walking here at ted in her underwear -- is that i found a few things .
and i want to show you my co-author for this week .
does it sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;ll give you some of the lessons that i think you &apos;re thinking or not , from these foundations , not to wear new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the bright tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost look at a lot of the time for less than 50 dollars .
this whole artery , including the jacket , has 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this whole week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost random impossible to be bad , and it &apos;s a bad way to be wearing pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you pull other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation is completely dominated .
i spent a lot of time my life to try to try and try and adapt to myself , and i think i &apos;m going to adapt to it .
are you just who you are .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , they &apos;re not just going to understand it , they &apos;re going to appreciate it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people say , i saw , when i &apos;m going to go to the rest of your own , or i remember her t-shirts .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
kew : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re going to see it in something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think they &apos;re not good in something good , they probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only as i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
if you believe that you &apos;re inside and outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone here in this audience .
we should be able to rock everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden , the golden .
and finally , saturday : a own , unique , personal style to develop a great way of telling the world about a little bit without telling you a word .
and it was always proven to me and again , when in this week people were in me , just because of what i was wearing . and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home , i &apos;ll go back to brooklyn .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn is to learn that it &apos;s okay to let .
i don &apos;t have to be emotionally , because the same thing is , it &apos;s always a different crazy , and the corner of the corner is to give you a different crazy , and you &apos;re just waiting for me if i love a little bit of love in the heart and you can search .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good day , all together .
i &apos;ve got something that i want to show you .
think of this as a flying , as flying as flying .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , the design design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and everybody &apos;s growing in italy is growing with this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is a very interesting thing in the last decades .
a few time ago , it was that if you wanted to win a formula , they took her budget and put her money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver was good enough , they won the race .
now , you need to get to get a race , actually , as you want to win , something like this -- something that &apos;s going to be made in real time , some thousand sensors , the information of the car , and then they use this to use and use this car to make it happen and then use these cars .
this would be , in a computer , a computer call .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is from two parts -- a part of a part of the and a half .
what &apos;s interesting today is the most interesting thing to do in our lives .
our cities were , in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to be the computer in the free .
and as a computer in the free , they start to respond to other ways , and they &apos;re driven .
if we &apos;re cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
just by the way , i want cities to be only two percent of the earth &apos;s earth , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population are living there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the most , to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
over the cities , all of this is going to be , and drive in objects of everyday life .
this is from a exhibition that paola antonelli for moma later , while the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , start to talk to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom out there , and a sensor is going to be a sensor and a sensor .
and that changes radically the interaction we have with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of avelile ...
you know , when the eisenhower shaped moses , it means he took the hammer , and he threw him on moses -- actually , you can see a little bit of a place -- and said , &quot; well , i &apos;m not talking to you ? &quot;
now , today , our environment starts to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with the perceive .
now the first project i want to introduce you to is in truth of one of the first our lab .
it was going to be a four years ago in italy .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually to use a new way of using the network that was used on the world -- that &apos;s a kind of a -- and anonymous and anonymous information from this network to use the world .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was as a italy won the most remote .
some of you will remember , it was as a italy against france , and then the end of the end , the most , the most , the most .
and no matter , italy won on the end .
now , you see what happened in this day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see the middle of the middle , the flow of flow .
the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline .
and earlier afternoon , people here and there , the calls and move .
the game starts -- silent .
france makes a gate . italy makes a gate .
and so , in favor , people are doing a short call , go on toilet .
second , the normal one . end of the normal .
first extension , second .
and in a moment of the most of the time , the most of the time .
italy wins . yeah .
well , in this night , all the center went to celebrate .
they saw the great concern .
the next day , all the center went to the center of the world and the prime minister to the same time .
and then all around .
you see the picture of the space , where , since the mexican time , people are going to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the following of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today , and a way of how we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
and a little bit of example , for feeling , is not about people , but it &apos;s not about people that we use and consume .
now we know all about where our things come .
this is a map that shows you all the chips , which is a mac of computers , like they came together .
but we just know about where the things go .
so we actually designed some little markers in this project to pursue the trash as he goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that we have , something more than a year ago , in seattle , which they &apos;re doing -- different kinds of things that you can see -- things that would throw you away .
then we have the little chips that little brands , the garbage , and then to pursue it .
here are the results that we have right now .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of a lot of the things in the system .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of a lot of a lot of the more sophisticated and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day , the cup that we throw away , not just disappears , you &apos;re still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we &apos;re going to throw away every day .
and if we would show the people , then we can move a behavior behavior .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , the most , a lot more about the perceive , could be a lot more about the perceive and the many other wonderful things that you can do with you , but i want to talk to the second part of our environment .
and the first project is something that we have a few years ago in the world .
it started with a question of the 50th , which came to us and said that spain and the most beautiful tradition have a beautiful tradition , in public places as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology with this ?
and one of the ideas that were in a sense of a profound deal was , imagine that tubes , and they were working , and they &apos;re going to work , and they &apos;re going to open up .
they &apos;re going to make what a kind of a computer system is like with a water of water .
if these are disappearing , you can write it , you can write patterns , images , text .
and you can see him , and he &apos;s going to open up to make them open , like you can see on this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of the mayor .
it &apos;s really like him .
and we got the mission to design a building in the entrance .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was from water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you &apos;re going to move it , it will open up and let them go into it .
the roof was covered with water .
and if it &apos;s expanding , if you want to reduce the allosphere , you can even leave the roof down .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture is going to be like , you know , this days , you know , this days , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; they &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they don &apos;t destroyed the building , it &apos;s just that architecture disappears almost .
here you see how the building works .
you see the person who asks what &apos;s happening inside .
and here you see me when i was trying to test the sensors that opened the water , not wet .
well , i should tell you what happened to the one night when all the sensors stopped .
but actually , it was a greater fun thing in this night .
all children from the building came to the building , because the kind of way they played with the building was very different .
not longer a building that would open up to make them open , but a building that still had broken and holes in the water , you had to jump without wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we think about how people are using things that we design .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beautiful thing to create things that are used and interact with people .
now here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical , the most remote of water , the projections .
and this is what brought us to think about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine that these are really going to be going to fly .
imagine , you could have little helicopter , which is going through the air , and everybody from them with a little bit of a little bit of light with a little bit of the time .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like that , which you &apos;ve seen before , which is completely moving with other , completely in the other , completely , completely , completely , completely , completely , completely , completely , completely , completely , completely , completely , completely , completely , completely , completely , completely , very in the other .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or irregular but in three dimensions , which is what changes , the light is not the position of the world &apos;s position .
you can play with different kinds of games .
imagine the screen could just appear in different ways or sizes , in different ways .
but then the whole one could be a 3d cloud of the world that you can go to , and they &apos;re moving through that , which you can look at from many , many directions .
here you see a real kind of a real kind of a little bit of the time that the most remote thing to form the world &apos;s .
if you turn the light , it looks like this . so as we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of people are being run .
it could have a impulse of a impulse that comes from people , from the movements of people or something .
i want to show you something here .
we &apos;ve worked with the most of the best dancers , one of the best dancers of our time -- the most the most , in new york , and the higgs boson in milan -- we &apos;ve taken his movements in 3d to use them as momentum for the most remote .
here you see a dance dance .
on the left , you see the most different , the different of the different things .
it &apos;s a very a more of the time , and a more of the time .
so that &apos;s how they can feel the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we all have all the most of the things that we have , you can play with color and the color of gravity and the way .
we want to use this as a kind of impulse for the most powerful .
i want to show you the latest project that we work on .
it &apos;s something that we work on in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is , imagine that , you know , that we &apos;re doing the people with the people who are doing something and change the environment -- almost like that , as we call it , and with a cloud .
imagine that every one of the little donation can give a little donation for a computer .
i think that the remarkable thing is the remarkable thing that &apos;s last decades , the last decades is that we &apos;re changing by a physical world .
this has all been true , knowledge , and it &apos;s accessible to the internet .
today , we can -- and the campaign obama has shown that -- we can see from the digital world , from the digital forces of networks to the physical world .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
that &apos;s what &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can be to ask us to ask the next challenges -- think of climate change , or the co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world to the physical world .
so the idea is that we actually have the people who are in the way they &apos;re doing things together , collective .
the cloud is again a cloud of the world &apos;s same way , which is a real cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud of the cloud .
it &apos;s a physical form of the city in london , but with the most remote .
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments for the african 2012 and the other way to use the relationship to the community .
so both that the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top of the top , like london new top of the top .
you can go .
and a kind of digital crystal in the night -- but as a result , a new kind of experience , a new way of experience all the time .
thank you .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important to do the relationship .
i &apos;m trying to express that people are not separated by nature and that everything is connected to each other .
the first time i was in antarctica , i was in antarctica , where i saw my first nazis .
i was born awe .
my heart is the way i was trying to make it , while i tried to make what was going on .
the nazis around me are almost 60 meters from the water , and i could only wonder that this was a preview on a different , year , year .
and the other , in the other hand , are born as a calf or by taking out of a glacier , and it &apos;s going out of the water .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they interact with clear with their environment and their experience .
some people are giving up and they &apos;re going to get to the mexican end , as others don &apos;t have more and more dramatic passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think they &apos;re isolated , separated and alone , as we can see people often .
but the truth is far away from it .
while a iceberg collapses , i &apos;m going to be a body atmosphere .
while the iceberg is flowing , he &apos;s going to get water out of the road , which feeds many life forms .
i &apos;m going to go to my footage of these turtles as if i would make portraits of my ancestors , in consciousness , that they exist in these individual moments , and never get back .
it &apos;s not death when you melt ; it &apos;s not a end , but a kind of a life of your life cycle .
part of the ice in the world i &apos;m very young is very young -- some thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last images i &apos;d like to show you is a iceberg that i have in the camps in greenland .
very rare , you actually witness a little bit of a iceberg .
here you see it .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the most remote .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man &apos;s there .
this is the average size of a computer .
he &apos;s about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just so , show you the iceberg a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really incredibly blessed by the work of some amazing projects .
but at the coolest , what i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy .
his name is a little bit of the name .
and the world &apos;s leading graffiti was one of the leading fellows of the &apos; 80s .
then one day , he came back from running and said , &quot; dad , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the way .
and the whole thing is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood up to him .
i have a company that makes design and animations , so it &apos;s actually a complex part of what we admire in the art art art .
so we decided to do tony -- and the thing to support .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
i just want to go back with him and i said , &quot; well , is that not -- i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all be the paralyzed people using this devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you heard to higher , and a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not available . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
anybody &apos;s film saw the film , and the &quot;
so they communicate -- so they &apos;re running up .
i was ashamed of , &quot; very much , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came to the need , just just a check , and instead of having a check , i didn &apos;t have the smallest idea of how i should get it to the bribe .
i was going to get to the place and the way to his brother and his father -- with the words , &quot; well , my proposal is like , &quot; tony will talk to him , and we &apos;ll find a way to get it back to his art .
because it &apos;s a hippie that someone who &apos;s going to carry all this into themselves , not communicate . &quot;
so i spoke some months later at a conference .
i met these people from the most of the time , graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on each surface , and then drawing a light on it , which is just the negative surface .
so they &apos;re moving around and make it like this .
they say that all of the things that are shown up there is a life cycle .
it starts with the organs , then the most the most , then the most , and the most famous thing to do is people actually do art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentation .
so i went home and ate with my wife , and she told her to night and we thought , &quot; well , second , if there &apos;s this technology , you can use a laser to control things , and that &apos;s what it would be like to control .
this was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization , and a lot of things , we &apos;ve reached some things .
first , we have the doors the doors , and actually get a device to be able to communicate with it -- a stephen , stephen .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really very funny -- i call him a little bit of it , because you &apos;re talking to him , or get a email , and thinks , &quot; i &apos;m so much as a guy , &quot; i &apos;m so much . &quot;
and we also have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us .
my wife , my children and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and the programmers and the programmers have taken our house .
many of our friends thought we &apos;re beautiful , that we &apos;re doing and we were all the images and all the images on the walls .
but for about two weeks , we &apos;ve been programmed to be the most popular , and we were involved in venice , my children , and we created this .
it &apos;s called the so-called , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap servant that we bought on the most remote of venice , something called a little bit of the water and a few things from the water and the most remote .
we took a more of the time , they have a little bit of a applied , and we have a device , and we have a device that &apos;s going to be available , you can build it , we can make the code free .
so we have created a device that &apos;s completely free from limitations .
no insurance can be a lot of insurance .
no hospital .
every paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of two weeks , we went back into the room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s the room of someone else and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all of these most promising unveiling before the great unveiling .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of planning , and the other day , he drew tony , and he drew tony to the first time after seven years .
and that &apos;s an amazing picture , because this is his life life system , and he looks beyond his life life life .
we have his bed to be able to see out of it .
we put a supercomputer on a wall of the hospital before the hospital .
and he drew back to the first time , in the southern school of his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a sense of the parking was on the parking parking .
so , we had to break in the parking parking , so we felt like a part of the most of the world &apos;s .
at the end , he sent us a email with a word , &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve been drawn to a little bit .
i feel that i was going to get underwater , and finally , someone was staying down and put my head down to my head so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that mind-blowing ?
this is something like our most of our favorite .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing in the track and it &apos;s always going to be able to develop .
and we have to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s going to be a second .
and somebody who has such a model of this model , made so much more .
so we &apos;re in terms of finding out how to do better and stronger .
since this time , we &apos;ve all got kinds of recognition .
we won a few awards .
think of it , it &apos;s free , no one deserves us .
it comes out of our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong &apos;s about us and then , in december , has honored us to illustrate the most , as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really neat .
the most , the most , is -- and that &apos;s the whole circle -- that this is april , in the middle of los angeles in the city of los angeles , a show called &quot; kind of the &quot; kind of the world &apos;s &quot; way &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there are probably the hardest representative of the most devastating representative of the world &apos;s -- the most , more , more , more , the guys , are going to be there .
and the show is part of the show , which is pretty high .
so basically , i &apos;m going to say , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , it &apos;s possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the most , the most , was not a impossible .
do it possible -- you all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer and i had never had something to do with a little bit of a little bit , but i just have something and i &apos;ve been surrounded with amazing people so that we could put something on the legs .
and this question should be a little bit of you , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing , which is what you &apos;ve got to do , if not now , when not i , who ? and if not me , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most likely to be more likely to do .
and i &apos;m always saying the people that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist .
you can have a farmer , or in leather , but nobody ever elected farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and admiration .
well , a epiphany is usually something that you find because you &apos;re going to fall somewhere .
you go to the block and take it as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard &apos;s .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at the &apos; 60s in the high school , ohio , where i was the most popular .
i was a person who was beaten every week in the front of green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using me the toilet in the front of the world .
it did it , it did .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it was proposed to san francisco , and i found a coin -- and then i found it important in the &apos; 80s .
about three or four years ago , i received a call in the night , a call of this teacher , woman , who said , &quot; i have to see it .
i &apos;m sad that we never learned each other as adults .
you can please come to ohio , and please come together with the man i know that you &apos;ve found it now .
and i should mention that i have a lot of time , and i want you to go to it . &quot;
now , the next day we were in cleveland .
we saw them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them , and we were sitting in the way we were , and we gave them to their family eight , because it was necessary , because it was necessary , it was necessary .
it was something that we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to learn me as adults , they kept me in a box full of the tracks , and it was put in my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation i talked about .
the revelation is a part of the life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that needs the rest of life .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is a lot of mentioned today .
he needs it as -- he would need , love and pleasure . and it &apos;s to give us these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , while they go on 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a motor engine , the visible , visible , dough , noise , sound , sound , free power .
that sounds very compelling .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat on a long time .
i was the only one who could talk to the most remote .
so i saw it , and they said , &quot; no problem , we probably have a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had already turned out and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot set up the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s not the route .
it turns out the motors .
imagine a computer plane .
and then he said three words -- the most , words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; the most devastating to the end . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk about the most remote thing .
i could see it in your eyes , because it was a little bit of a little bit of life .
i want to tell you three things that i learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything else is different .
we have this kind of thing , we have these things that we want to do in life and i thought , i thought , all the people i wanted to make a hand , and it didn &apos;t do all the fences i wanted to fix , and never made it .
while i thought about this , a adage was a saying , &quot; i collect bad to be . &quot;
because when the wine is far , and the person is there , i open it .
i never want to move something in life .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we were the george washington bridge , so pretty much to be , because i thought , human , because i was a really , really , a thing i really do .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i was going to be better in everything i &apos;m going to do .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve given my ego .
and i was visiting the time i cut for the most of the time , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to interrupt negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t have a lot of years to do with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have a little bit of , right ? i &apos;m going to get happy to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and that &apos;s the inner clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 , &quot; ...
you see the water .
i said , &quot; please flying down into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts , as you know it from a documentary .
while we &apos;re approaching , i had this feeling , human , to die .
almost as if we &apos;re going to prepare our lives for this .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness really is in a thought , which is that i just wish i &apos;m a wish .
i wish i could see my children growing up .
about a month after that , i visited a performance of my daughter -- radical , not much rocket talent ...
... not .
and i &apos;m going to be able to go to a little kid .
and in the world , everything was made for me .
i realized that i was going to be able to be able to be connected to the dots that it &apos;s just about being a great father .
more than anything else , everything else is my only goal in life , a good father .
i was going to be aware of the miracle that day not die .
i got another gift , which is in the future , and to live and live differently .
my call to all of that , is , is : imagine the same thing , is , you know , the same thing is , but you &apos;re not -- but how would you change ?
what would you do , which you &apos;re going to figure out because they &apos;re thinking they were forever there ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , you &apos;re the best parents that you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the slope of the slope is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want to build the bomb .
the most important post there for the development of nuclear weapons is the most important thing in the world .
the gray boxes that you see here are the most powerful .
now , if it &apos;s going to be , the systems are going to be to be able to control the systems , which are the most different and the ones that are actually able to cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with the most remote , and it &apos;s based on a completely different technology .
but if we do it , a effective more effective thing is that a effective thing is used to a laptop , which is used by a computer box to get this gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind the burning .
so we start with a computer system .
the most expensive thing is going to go to the gray box , touched the centrifuge and the iranian of the italian , and the iranian .
this is a little bit of a time , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started to get our research six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was the sense and purpose of this kind of thing .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated what the most complicated part of the world is , the most powerful part , he made the most compelling .
and it seemed to be a little bit more a little bit of a little bit of these gray boxes , these of the gray boxes .
the curved our attention and we started a project , where we were infected with our environment , and studied this building .
and then something weird happened .
and so , the way a result is , like a computer , which is not like the cheese , and it didn &apos;t want to eat him .
this was not a sense of my eyes .
and after we &apos;ve been experimenting with different kinds of cheese , i went to me that this is a more likely attack .
completely on a particular goal .
the most efficient runs on the gray box , when a particular configuration was discovered , even if the special program , which is trying to be infected in this goal .
and if not , then it &apos;s not going to be .
so , that really was my interest and we started working with it , almost about the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , a u.s. african power river , or a more of the world &apos;s power .
so we should soon find out what the goal is .
so , we &apos;re going to get the most powerful code and we found the code that he &apos;s in two digital terms of the world -- a smaller and bigger .
and we also fell on that they were very professional , from people who were obviously available to all of the information .
they knew any bits and the ones that they had to attack .
probably they knew the most little the most important of the world &apos;s most likely .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already noticed that the most complex of the slope of the slope of the slope is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the most important thing is , the science is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more complicated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this kind of thing .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
looks like the humanities of the way that the humanities are .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code .
so after what we were looking for as first , they were a lot of the time , because we know what these are .
and then we looked for the most of the time and i tried to get this with the real world in connection -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could show or prove .
so , to make this theories , we call us in memory that it &apos;s definitely about the most important , and it &apos;s got to be a set of a goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran because most infections were reported .
now , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
basically it goes out of the nuclear nuclear power and the most on the world &apos;s power .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all experts for a fool and nuclear power . &quot;
and i called them , and i was going to know her to compare their expertise to what we have in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital data to the most complex .
the bollywood is this moving part of the centrifuge , these black object that you see .
and if you manipulated the speed of this kind of thing , you actually can actually get the butter and even , and then even the centrifuge explode .
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was actually , it &apos;s slowly going to be done and make it incredibly amazing -- obviously in trying to make it happen to be able to get a fast way to get it .
the big digital system -- we got a glimpse by looking at us very precisely , and we looked at the data .
so for example , the number of a little bit of the code is very out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started to do scientific literature , which is how these enlightened are built in the water , and found that they &apos;re a mess in the so-called called the so-called , and every single one of the things that contains the most little of the time .
so this made sense , it &apos;s increasing together .
and it was better .
these irregular in iran are divided in 15 called the levels of the levels .
and guess what we found in the world &apos;s most ?
a almost identical structure .
so again , that &apos;s really good together .
and this gave us big confidence for that , which we studied here .
well , don &apos;t understand me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go .
these results were made by several weeks hard .
and often we just ran into a dead and we had to collect ourselves .
anyway , we found that both digital is actually in a way and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little one is taking a little bit of a time , and the cursor and slowed down and slowed it down and the big kind of a little bit of the more , with six of the things in interaction and manipulated .
so , in the big and all of us , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have what the goal is .
it &apos;s a lot of the time , and it &apos;s just a more of the time .
so we have to worry about that other goals could be hit by the periphery .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- really made me out of the 1950s .
there &apos;s the gray box down there , and the top is the visceral box .
now , what this thing is is that it &apos;s the supply of sensors of sensors -- so for example , from the most of the time , and it &apos;s a little bit available to the code , and it &apos;s going to be available to the attack that &apos;s going on , with false distances .
and in fact , this false data data is taken by the data before .
so it &apos;s like in the car industry , where the car car is being fed with before .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the idea of this is obviously not just the most , the most devastating in the control of the control .
in fact , it &apos;s much dangerous and more sophisticated .
the idea is to be a digital digital system .
we need digital energy systems where a human being can &apos;t react fast enough .
so in a power station , for example , if the big world &apos;s going to be too fast , you have to open up in milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human being .
so , we need digital energy systems .
and if the risk of risk are , then you can really happen .
the power power can explode .
and neither the most , even the most remote thing is going to notice it .
this is scary .
but it &apos;s still worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this attack is a lot of the attack .
he doesn &apos;t have anything special with a hostile , with a lot of the time .
so he would work for example , for example , in a power station or in a solar station .
it &apos;s a lot of the time .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the bake lobe -- you have to be able to stick the most of the time on a stick .
you could use ordinary technology to spread technology .
you have to just spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you &apos;ll eventually get a computer organization .
that &apos;s the consequence that we need to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most powerful environments .
we need to ask the consequences and we &apos;re going to prepare better to prepare .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was reported very much of that , that people think that the most of the time that the most is the most important thing behind it .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
i think the most is involved in the world &apos;s way , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind it is the most remote superpower .
there &apos;s only one and that &apos;s the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise our problem would even be bigger .
thank you that you have a divorce of a commodity . thank you ralph .
i spent the last few years to place in situations that usually are very difficult and at the same time .
i went to jail -- hard .
i worked in a computer system -- dangerous .
i filmed in a shot -- hard and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days with this , nothing as this -- fun at the beginning , a little bit more difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
and i actually have the biggest part of my career , and i &apos;ve been exposed to a terrible part of my career , and that &apos;s just for trying to study social , and it &apos;s a little bit of understanding what they &apos;re doing for the audience and make it accessible to the audience .
so when i knew that i would come here to look at a tedtalk that &apos;s going to look at the world of the world &apos;s world , and i knew that i would make a little bit more .
some of you may have heard that i &apos;ve been visiting a display in ebay .
i sent a few of the things , some of the most , some of the most , and i gave people the opportunity to be the most , the most remote thing in my tedtalk in 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , and they were , they got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson never will be going to be the same thing .
so what you got was that , you know , her name here : my tedtalk , from the one that you don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be the subject , and the you can get to the content , especially if i put your company dumb .
but it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
that &apos;s just the most of the most , by the way .
so despite that warning , i knew anybody would buy the most of the most .
so if you asked me this year , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this with confidence .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
and i said , i &apos;ve been in some pretty terrible situations , but nothing could prepare me to do nothing , and i could do anything like that , and so dangerous as with these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is a film about the most , a film about the most , marketing and advertising , which is the whole movie that &apos;s funded by the whole movie , marketing and advertising .
and the film will be called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
so what &apos;s going on in the world &apos;s most , the most , is that everything , from top to the end , is completely , completely with brands , the beginning of the world that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand &apos;s brand .
now this brand , the most powerful stadium , the most remote center ...
these people are being connected to the film in the friendship -- forever .
and so the film is going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in the friendship , for forever ?
i &apos;m a person &apos;s person .
that was more to realize .
it was &quot; in the friendship , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x than a computer , but we &apos;re going to be sure that we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the movie .
so we might sell a shoe and he will be the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever carried ...
the greatest car that you &apos;ve ever been the dangers of &quot; the most , &quot; the most the most , the greatest drink that they &apos;ve ever had , have a attention of &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the
so the idea is to show you that brands are part of life , actually , they &apos;re to get the film to fund the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
they &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of the bureaucratic .
so this is the whole concept that &apos;s all the movie , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy if you could help , and i would be able to do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny because i heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how to be people .
have you got a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use perspective , because that &apos;s a negative thing -- but you know how to develop that ?
how much money is needed to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth a lot of really , a few really known brands .
who knows when the film comes out , we might see how a warning of a concept of the process .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
the answer is very likely to be , &quot; no &quot; no .
but is it a difficult thing for the film or a difficult thing to me ?
kathryn : both .
... so , not so optimistic .
so , my gentleman , you can help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think what brands .
yes .
if you look at people who you have to do .
there are some places that we can turn .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera &quot; would mean that we wanted to lead a more of the time .
it turns out that it meant that it was actually not to do anything . &quot;
and just like this , all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
no one wanted to do something with the film .
i was amazed .
they wanted to do absolutely nothing with the project .
and i was confused because i thought that the whole concept , the idea of advertising is so many people like possible to present it as many people as possible .
especially in the world today , in this interface of new and old media , and the photons of media media -- is not the idea that the masses brings these message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea was a computer error , and that was the way that it was .
actually no , that was not the mistakes .
that would have been no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but that &apos;s what this picture is , is a problem .
look , if you &apos;re going to transparency at the most unequal time , this is one of the first images that seems .
i really like your way , sergey brin .
this was the problem : transparency -- free from deception and the most , just to discover and worship ; immediately , from the currents , and the access to information , especially what &apos;s going on -- the last line is the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a whole lot of transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but if it comes to it , it &apos;s going to be implemented , it changes something .
but why ? well , transparency is terrified -- like this strange bear , which still reflect .
it &apos;s a lot of the strange highway -- like this strange highway .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is even risky ?
a whole dish cool food .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to companies , and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want to tell you that you &apos;re going to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we want to just tell you that you &apos;re telling our story . &quot;
look , when i was a kid , and my father was caught me in the lie -- and he &apos;s sitting and look at me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions .
there are your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
but there &apos;s only one company , a agency , to help us -- and that &apos;s just because i &apos;ve been john bond and richard .
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , a profound problem is a profound problem .
i have friends who make big , giant , giant , and i have friends who are doing little more , like i do .
and my friends , the great , giant , giant , say that the reason why their films are so successful , the most successful thing they have .
and then my friends , who make little more , &quot; well , how should we compete with these big , giant , giant ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
so how exactly are we going to see the veterans in the movie ?
whenever i do that , and whenever i open the world &apos;s way , you &apos;ll see the aluminum , you &apos;ll see them .
and every time i &apos;m going to get somebody &apos;s , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
they &apos;re far ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you to calm up .
so maybe you should be a little bit of the interview of this . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great most amazing things .
either &quot; the fusion fusion &quot; or a &quot; paradise &quot; , you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped both for men as well as women -- found , or a stick , whatever .
this is the most powerful .
now i can answer all your questions and give you a loan .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
so as you talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand as a brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like others .
so , things like that -- you know , people remember the wetlands -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
what words would you describe ?
and the protests is a lot of the time .
this is a great question .
and the technology is , technology technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone &apos;s going to do under the clinic .
we talk about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that these category really make a difference to something positive , unlike &quot; fighting smell and moisture . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them longer fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three feet , three feet .
these things have a more positive effect .
and that &apos;s a kind of a kind of a .
what about me ? what about the most of the time ?
i have to talk to the man on the street that are like me , and i &apos;m like , &quot; i &apos;m going to be .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i like to really like beautiful clothes .
the &apos; 80s is true on the world , except on the most remote .
well , what is the brand of the brand ?
unique .
i think the most important thing that the style i have is , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
i like many black colors , many of the most , many of the things that i like , and so a stuff .
but normally , i have a kind of a computer , like the monthly , or a jewelry , and so a stuff .
if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classic magnificent .
man 2 : the brand i &apos;m , i would say , i would say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say .
two : part of foreplay , part of the brain , part of the , part of the -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the most of the time .
i sell the entire country throughout the country .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , devastating industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex because i was a lot of the time .
man 5 : brand &apos;s brand &apos;s brand .
does this go ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a kind of a computer .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t be all the most important , but i often see me on the interface of the brain glamour and the fly .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed a experts .
i needed someone who could go in my head , somebody who could really help me understand what you call the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so i found a company called self-assembly &apos;s .
they have companies like a computer , and they have helped , to discover these kinds of things .
if you could do it for the do , they could also help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me just a little bit like that with your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who are my worldview .
tell me about this world .
and the world : this world ? i think the world is the world , where you live -- how people around a around , the family , the family , the way you live , the work and so .
all these things come and start from a place , and for me , and i start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing that you want to talk about .
the next thing . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what is the idea of the idea and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; -- what does you bring us ?
what is the most important thing ? what &apos;s the most common thing ?
why is it important , the way that it is important ? what does the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little more about them , that &apos;s not you .
what else do you have through ?
... that doesn &apos;t have to be afraid . what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
and the way . no , thank you .
thank you for your patience .
yes . well . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to do .
there &apos;s a lot of crazy things that went out there .
the first thing i saw was that that idea was that their own favorite two separate , but they have a lot of pages -- the morgan is a kind of a brand / a brand .
the light add very well .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction that &apos;s happening .
and i think some companies are going to focus on a strength instead of both .
many companies tend to be -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re going to avoid , and they &apos;re going to make them welcome to themselves , and it &apos;s actually a little bit of a turn .
what other brands do that do ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , the target , wii , bernie from the protests , and the most remote .
now , there &apos;s a lot of brands and the brain brands , these things that come and go , but a more powerful , brand brand is a pretty strong thing .
a more of the time , the brand brand . how is your brand ?
if someone would ask them to describe their own , their own favorite , their own , how would they ?
you put them a more , a little bit of it , is it that the blood is bringing in the world ?
or are you more likely to be a more of the time ?
are you something that a little bit down , a little bit more , conservative , conservative ?
and the things that are the most important things that are the economists , fresh as the most , is the way the most remote , the way the most , failed , failed and the way the most devastating , agile and agile , and the agile , and the more , like the same .
or are you more like a kind of a kind of a more than a more ?
are you going to be able to get out and the way of the way ?
are they exposed , traditionally , , in general , the compassionate , compassionate like oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , more , safe , surely , miss , holy , and the dalai lama , or the dalai lama ?
in the course of the movie , we had more than 500 companies , the top and the ones were saying , &quot; no , because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they wanted to do nothing with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control about the finished product .
but it &apos;s going to be 17 of the most successful , which were willing to get on these control , which wanted to make someone so precise and error as i , and then the stories that we can &apos;t do , and i think stories that would never support .
they &apos;re going to tell us the story of the world &apos;s story , like we tell the story that you &apos;re using today , to be used to the brain &apos;s brain , both to be a ads of the brain , and to make films .
we went to sao paulo where the most of the time was banned .
in the entire city , there &apos;s no more a little bit of a little bit of a poster , no poster , no one , nothing .
and we went in school , where companies are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in the way in the way in america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback or where i had the biggest success , those are where i have things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they thought the middle , they thought the agencies , and they said that the agencies may not really have their interest in sense .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist right .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people think is to think that our view of the view is that our view of the view is that our view of work .
and how did that be for them ? what it &apos;s successful ?
now , there was the film in the workforce , and we could see that we can look at this .
according to the first thing , the first thing was , in january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million of this film .
it actually includes one time from two one of the two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no tv .
the film was not going to be completely skeptical .
there &apos;s not even the online thing . no more .
it &apos;s not coming out in other countries .
well , finally , the film has a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every ad , with that we &apos;ve explained to their clients , the finger of it .
something i think is , if you &apos;re going to take your chance to take risks , you can take risks that in these risks .
i think if you hold people out of it , you get it closer to failure .
i think if you trained his employees to avoid risks , you &apos;re prepared to get a profit to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunities that you might be able to do .
finally , we should be afraid of fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
they &apos;re welcome to fear .
and so , a big taste of a big taste , so we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , we get a little bit of honesty .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; she &apos;s welcome transparency to you , &quot; you know , the good friends of the computer who are paid for the most good friends for the most remote .
big data is transformed for organizations all over the world in big opportunities .
&quot; you &apos;re going to welcome transparency to &quot;
thank you .
now morgan , in the name of transparency , is this : what &apos;s happening with the dollar ?
this is a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , and i put on the most of the time of the most , the most remote , the most , a check in the height of $ a year to fund my favorite year .
my name is a little bit of a book .
18 months ago , i made something else at google , and i &apos;m going to do something with museums and art . my favorite , which is also , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of the things that i can tell you , and stories that i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the show .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and your access .
i grew up in india .
i was a great education , i &apos;m not going to be aware of -- i didn &apos;t have to -- but i had a lot of museums and this artwork .
when i went to visit and the museums , i started learning a lot of learning .
and while i worked for google , i tried to make this desire -- art accessible to technology -- with technology together .
we then created a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and you &apos;ll tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you &apos;re just going to get too much too much too .
you can see in all these museums here .
there &apos;s the most the most , the moma , the moma , the most , the van gogh , the van gogh .
i actually come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of kind of new york .
you get on two because it &apos;s very simple .
and the most , and the most , you know , is in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- freeman , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and the art of the art .
you want to be able to disappoint in the museum ?
open the map , and jump with a click .
in the middle of them , they want to be to the end of the gangs .
just further . much fun .
they &apos;re busy .
thank you , but the best is still coming .
so i &apos;m a half of my favorite , a computer of the pavilion in the met .
i see this biomaterial .
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
so this is one of the images .
this is all the main ones .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click that way .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve been able to have with the so-called the so-called .
for example , this picture has about 10 billion years of the way , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can very easily go into it and the most remote .
you see something funny here .
i love this guy ; his expression is a bit more likely .
but then you really want to be deep in it .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there &apos;s something that &apos;s going on .
and i thought , &quot; wait , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and i realized slowly , that kids actually give up something .
i was doing a little bit of known with some known known at met , and actually found that it &apos;s a game called a a duck called the a blade of a stick on the top of a stick .
apparently it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really go close to the very late , you can go to the the the the the the .
just to give you the picture of the picture , i &apos;m going to see what you &apos;re going to get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is , in a second .
let &apos;s jump fast to moma , again in new york .
another more of me , a more of me .
and the previous example of the previous example was to find details .
but what if you want to see the beating ?
and what if you want to see van gogh &apos;s way to do this masterpiece ?
you &apos;re going to go in . you can really go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom in one of my favorite , and i &apos;m going to zoom on the tracks .
this is a lot of the time that it &apos;s never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing time .
this is really cool part , he &apos;s called the collections .
everybody from them , every -- the same , or poor , whether they have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and create your own museum , and you can create your own museum -- all these images you can put your own collection .
just just , they go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of the brain -- you can get the power of the world .
this is the most popular , in the world &apos;s most , in the world .
you can put everything with the criteria , send your friends , and so a conversation starts to start what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think finally , it &apos;s the main thing that all the wonderful things are not coming from google .
they &apos;re not even coming from the museums .
i should not say that .
they come from artists .
and that was a experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to be just going to be in this digital medium of art , and they represent it online .
so , the biggest question is , the biggest question i asked is , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a computer system ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can split in two camps .
this is the left half the logical side , and then the right half , the intuitive side is .
if we had a scale to measure the world &apos;s brain , we could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the brain .
for example , this is the one that &apos;s completely logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you be able to improvise your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have been for one of these extreme , but i think that most people in the audience , their brain looks like this -- with a high school , the same thing in both of the workforce .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both praying or something .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i see as one of the people in common with most of the experimental experimental , which needs a good percentage of logic to put together the complex ideas .
but at the same time , we need a good percentage of intuition to actually do experiments .
how do we develop these intuition ? well , we love playing with things .
so we go out and play it and look like it &apos;s going to react . and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the things they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that a thing can be the same time to be in a place .
i mean , it can sound strange about thinking that a thing is to be a little bit of different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed them .
i remember a child at the play of a child .
he was still a billionaire and not very good at it , and he was constantly going to go .
but i bet that it &apos;s going to be taught by the most valuable lesson , which is the great things that you don &apos;t just leave you , and that they stay on a place .
and that &apos;s a great model of the world , so long they don &apos;t have a more of the time .
it would be a terrible model for a computer system because they don &apos;t play with the same , but with these little strange particles .
and if you play with your particles , you &apos;re all able to find some kind of weird things -- like that you &apos;re flying directly through walls , or that they can be at two different places .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the one of the physics of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little little particles .
but you didn &apos;t have to describe them about the great everyday objects around us .
that &apos;s not what my intuition didn &apos;t admire and maybe because i don &apos;t often play that way with particles .
well , i &apos;m sometimes playing with you , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical side is not liked .
because if all of the things are from particles , and all these particles are going to follow the rules of quantum mechanics , then not just all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that shouldn &apos;t be like that .
so i would feel better with the whole thing if we could show that everyday school is also the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a few years ago , right ?
i created one .
this is the first object you can see , that was in the most remote .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
here i &apos;m going to zoom up with something . we look at the center here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal , which is shaped as a leader , and it &apos;s about the edge of the edge .
so i made this thing on similar ways to make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new york , and i was going to get a 100 hours of all the big devices .
and i had to build my own machine for the last little , and i had to build this kind of swim , and to get the thing .
this thing has the ability to be the ability to be in the world &apos;s brain , but it needs a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i &apos;m all making some kind of weird things , but then , i &apos;m going to get other people to do that , because i don &apos;t want to do it with it , or , frankly , they &apos;re not going to be .
so quantum mechanics says that the objects are going to feel like it &apos;s just feeling .
the fellow bias for the objects are not only people , but also the light that seems to you and the wind that &apos;s going to be over to you and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is going to be doing the metal , we had to get out of all the time .
and we did that .
we &apos;ve got the light off , put it into a vacuum and the whole air , and it &apos;s the whole air , and it &apos;s almost to be the elevator , and it was the piece of metal , as always as it wanted .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it really moves .
instead , it &apos;s just quiet there , and it &apos;s a way of doing it , the way it was about this -- like this -- like a , and together , the same thing .
and we gave him a little push , we could make it a little bit of time to unite and not to unite -- something just in quantum mechanics is allowed to be allowed .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what really fantastic .
what does it mean for a object to unite the same time and not to unite ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion of atoms are the piece of metal that is silent and the same time , and the same atoms are moving on and down .
just too much , they &apos;re going to be aware of .
the rest of time are the rest of the time .
that means that every atom is at the same time in two different places , which is the whole piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
this was worth to me for all these year in the clean space , because , check that , the most , the most , the most little of the atom between a single atom and this piece of metal is about the difference of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at two different places , this piece of metal can be two different places , why not then they ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine , you &apos;d be at the same time , how would that feel ?
how would your consciousness deal with that is that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
when we &apos;re doing it , the light and the box is going to be the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece of metal .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator in fact , the only thing that is in a small space .
they hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right ; it &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more than it &apos;s more than it &apos;s more deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , define who they are . and that &apos;s the profound and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we should be able to think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families think about where they &apos;re living and work , they have given the opportunity to be in the way between at least a hand , which all of the people are in competition .
now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries that are not even available to the single city that they &apos;re welcome to .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more worth it than it costs to build .
so we could just just do the world very simple with the world , maybe hundreds of new cities .
now that sounds absurd for you , and you probably never thought about new cities .
but just trade the building of apartments against cities .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in homes , did this already ; the other half but not yet .
they could try to expand the capacity of the capacity to expand existing apartments .
but you know what they would be doing in these apartments , and their environment are going to be able to avoid laws and the interest .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to get all of these the whole things .
but you could go to a completely new place , a completely new urban level , and the laws would be there , and it &apos;s not going to be able to support it .
so i proposed to governments that are new areas that provide enough space for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
later , i found that , about the same time , the same time , and the challenge of a reform of reform in the world &apos;s challenge .
they knew that every year , every year , each year , they were leaving their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people are going to stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in the same .
and in this place , the most , i said , &quot; what happens when we &apos;re a half of the land of our country , what if we just get a message of the american message , and if people want to work , you can do it , and can you go to the surface of the the world , and you can do it . &quot;
in 2009 , in 2009 , in 2009 , among a significant of a severe , a very severe .
the next thing that the next thing that &apos;s the next thing is , the first of the time , won to be won to be a shift , which is the program both of the innovations , as well as the same thing .
he asked the day to become a , his favorite .
in the meantime , i was going to be on an talk at tedglobal .
by improvement , try and the study of consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter in the essence of the city .
the first point , the importance of laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to do existing .
we pay new technologies , but for progress , it takes technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually the laws of the laws that are going to be given us .
in 2010 , a friend sent a friend from guatemala to the gesture .
again , it showed him a little bit of the time .
the two calls me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december in december of a hotels in miami .
i tried to make sure how valuable cities are , to be like a lot more valuable they are than they cost .
and i used this chart to show how valuable is a place like new york . think that a surface in some cases is a meter of thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , in a place than it had a break , and he said , &quot; paul , could we look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk put in very simple form that a charter city is a place that is the beginning of the country , the beginning of the country , which suggests the laws that are going to be there , either under these rules , or not .
so , i was asked by the president of the president , which meant that we need to do this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to bring our country to the country .
i was asked to get to the last one , and then again , the fourth and fifth january of january .
so i &apos;ve been thinking about a different job , and i thought , the one graph , which involves this graph , is trying to make that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch represents the new airport that was built in a hostile room .
and this airport has a surface of 100 of the u.s. .
so i tried to convince the most of the time to make a new city , you have to start with a field of at least 1,000 .
these are more than 250 thousand morning .
polite all the most promising .
the teacher of the audience were very serious and attention .
the ladder of congress came on the stage and said , &quot; professor &apos;s favorite , thank you for your talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the line that a new city provides people new possibilities .
there were the possibility of living in a city that would be in a city of the north , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also involves new possibilities for leaders with a .
the leaders of government were represented in the help of the help , they could benefit from their own , which they could use in the laws of the laws of the charter and in the creation that everybody can actually trust it .
and the realization of president fischeri was that the confidence of the endangered over the world i thought has been to get to the foreign investors and to build this city for all parties in the other few years , which has been suffering for many years of fear and mistrust .
we &apos;re in a field .
this picture is from this place .
it &apos;s easy to be easy to be a thousand square square square miles .
and shortly after that , at january january , they voted at congress for a change to have a change to have a more of the world &apos;s population , which is a special thing for special .
in a country that &apos;s just a very intense crisis behind the congress , in congress , to a voice with a voice .
all parties , all the most , all the world &apos;s society , supported this .
and to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved by congress .
at the 17th february , it was approved to be approved to a voice .
immediately after that choice , between the 21st and 24 february , a scourge of about 30 , a scourge of about 30 places of the world , the most interested in the business of the world &apos;s business .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new urban center that built in south korea , as the national army .
everything you can see on this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the preacher .
the other place , which was very interested in the korean , is singapore .
it was built two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you look at it , it &apos;s what we &apos;re going to be in today .
they already have a kind of a computer ; they &apos;re already looking at this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already working on a legal system that is allowed to participate , and it &apos;s also working on an external field .
a country has already offered his top court to put the top court , as a court for the most remote system of the world .
and also , the most interested and the most interested in the world are very interested .
they even bring funding with a .
one thing , as you know already , was already a lot of the time , there &apos;s a lot of the most powerful .
there are many companies who like to put in america , especially in a place with a free level , and there are many people who would like to live there .
in the world , there are 700 million people who say that they like to live in a different place .
a million people left a year latin america and go into the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to be forced their families to be able to be able to be working in order to work with work sometimes , and they &apos;re going to have to make their own money to eat and make clothing .
unfortunately , sometimes , they &apos;re actually children trying to find their parents , who they have , in some cases , for a decade .
so what is it for an idea to think about it in the other of the way to build a whole new city ?
or even to build these cities , or hundreds of the world around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to be that every family has a choice between several cities that are in competition to be new residents ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends from the exclusive , i asked myself to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many choices you do on a typical day ?
do you know how many choices you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve done a survey with 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that are a typical american american , is a typical american man in a day .
and also , a study was done with ceos , which they saw a week for a week .
and these scientists just set up the different topics with these ceo , and how much time they spent decisions that are going to be supported with the issues .
and they found that a average ceo in the week with the most remote tasks .
each of these topics was from many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were hit within nine minutes or less .
just for about 12 percent of their decisions , they needed an hour or more of their time .
think of your own decisions .
you know how many choices you meet in the nine minutes of category in the one hour ?
how good do you think they &apos;re the decisions to deal with it ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest most of our modern time , the most remote .
i want to talk about the problem and over some possible solutions .
well , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;ll ask you some questions and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise them , because i &apos;m blind , just the hand if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i &apos;m going to ask you if i ask you a question , and your answer is , so , my first question is , is you ready to hear something about the most of the time ?
thank you .
when i was a more of the stanford university at stanford university , i went to this very very very very very very supportive store .
it was a store that was called the most of the time .
this business , it was almost like a kind of a kind of a kind of a .
they had 250 different types of mustard and oil and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was a time than we actually drink .
i loved to this business , but to a while , i asked myself , well , how does it come to me ?
here &apos;s the olive olive gang .
they had 75 different kinds of olive olive olive olive olive oil , including the ones that were locked in boxes , which came from a thousand years old .
so i decided to visit the leader , and i asked the ladder , &quot; works this model that they really offer the people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up the most on the world &apos;s most day , and he was usually coming to her cameras .
we decided to do an experiment and we chose to be a experiment for our experiment .
here &apos;s her favorite gang .
they had a different species of the world &apos;s different species .
we &apos;ve set up a little bit of a little bit of a sudden on the entrance of business .
we have six different tastes , or 24 different tastes , and we put it in two things , and we looked at two things , first , i would stay in the case of the people , and they try to try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and
it &apos;s more people , when it was 24 , about 60 percent when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we saw that in which the people were more likely to be a glass of glass .
now we saw the opposite effect .
from the people who were there as 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass of glass .
from the people who were there as it was six , now we saw that 30 percent of them bought a glass of them .
well , if you calculate it , people bought six times more a glass of the who they had six to choice when they had 24 to choice .
now , to decide not to buy glass , probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the most important thing is that the most sophisticated thing is affected .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it comes to our own interests .
so the theme of the day : financial protection .
so i &apos;m going to describe you a study that i &apos;m going to do with a lot of the time , and i &apos;m doing a study of the world &apos;s own , and i was doing the decisions that we &apos;re doing for the decisions of almost one million americans in the entire united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most , which was a kind of a kind of a computer plan , which is the probability of whether more for tomorrow is saved .
and we found that there was a context in fact .
so in these plans , we had about a lot of plastic plans that people had to offered between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund was offered that , in fact , the participation was lower .
if you look at the extreme , the plans , the two fund , had a kind of a , in the 1970s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans , that almost 60 fund offered the most , the most remote thing .
now , turns out that even if you &apos;re going to participate , if more possibilities were , even then , it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , rather than that , is that the more possibilities are available to them , the more they have to catch it and fund it .
the more possibilities you &apos;ve been available to , the more they put their money in pure .
no one of these extreme decisions , to the decisions that someone would recommend , if we &apos;re making their future financial well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three key negative consequences that offer that to more and more choices with it .
they &apos;re going to make the decision -- push it , even if it &apos;s against your own best interest .
they &apos;re more likely to make decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re going to decide more for things that they &apos;re happy to ask even less , even if they make objective better .
the main reason that we might be able to enjoy it may be able to enjoy these huge shelves full of the other of the brain , mustard , oil and the other , but we can &apos;t actually take the comparison and the limits of the fantastic supply .
so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested on different ways and on different types of things -- that you can use in your business .
first , just , you know .
they &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today , that less is more .
people are always worried when i say , &quot; you know . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing their own .
but in fact , we &apos;re always seeing more and more , that if you &apos;re ready to be able to be able to get and the most devastating possibilities , now there &apos;s a rise of sales , and there &apos;s a increase of the sales .
as a result , and the oyster and the other head of 26 , and the different head of 26 , they experienced a rise of sales to 10 percent .
when the golden corporation corporation sell her 10 , they experienced the worst , they experienced that the profit to grow the monthly percent -- a result of both , the rise of sales and reducing costs .
you know , the average of the average , you can tell you 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart provides them today 100,000 products .
but the most , the supermarket , the supermarket today , is the world &apos;s supermarket , and they just offer them 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in doses .
now in the world of the world , i think one of the best examples that has been in the market recently , like you &apos;re best the choice , was something that david &apos;s very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s been offered in harvard .
every single harvard employees are automatically taking on a piece of a part of a piece .
and that &apos;s what really a choice wants to do , 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to go .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different .
and if your employees can &apos;t be able to be able to do it , you can &apos;t do your clients . &quot;
now before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be ready to offer all people in this audience in the audience .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read you .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read them and then i ask them to clap when they &apos;re ready to take gary &apos;s supply .
okay . everybody &apos;s ready to take gary &apos;s supply .
are that all ?
well , let me show you something more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve heard more hands .
good .
and the fact is that it &apos;s a mystery that you &apos;ve seen , the first time , more information than the second time , but i would think it &apos;s going to be real real time .
because the images were really difficult for them .
what &apos;s going to bring me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of the world &apos;s problem , it &apos;s the most powerful .
it &apos;s about understanding the difference between possibilities , understanding what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that consequences must be driven by the consequences and the very specific .
why are people going to give 15 to 30 percent more than they use a computer card or a card card , as a computer card ?
because it &apos;s not us really .
and it turns out that if you make it , something feels specific , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people .
so we &apos;ve been able to have a study that i made with a lot of the time and a cup of the process of the world , and we &apos;ve made a study with people in the world &apos;s own -- employees , who were working for their participation .
and as this meeting , we &apos;ve been leaving this meeting exactly as you &apos;ve been , just we &apos;ve added a little bit .
the little ones we &apos;ve been facing was that we &apos;ve asked people to think just all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they would save money .
and we did this simple thing that we did , there was a rise of participation to 20 percent and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or a rise to four percent of the amount of money that they were willing to pay for for the most remote .
the third technology : the third technology .
we can deal with more categories than more choices .
so here &apos;s for example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a computer system .
it turns out that it &apos;s in the top industry , and down in the northeast area , the number of the different kinds of magazines to high , to the very high magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines , and you &apos;re going to show you 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 magazines , and that in 20 categories , you believe that i gave you more choices and a better way to give you the one when i gave you the 600 .
because the categories tell me how to hold them apart .
here are two different types of things .
one is called jazz , and the other is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you think that the left is the left , and the ad on jazz is jazz , then you clap in your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
if you think that the left on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is , you know , you &apos;re clapping .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out that they &apos;re right .
the left on the left is jazz and the right , but you know what ?
this is a very high kind of a very high system .
the categories have to say something that &apos;s not the choice of the choice .
and this problem often , if you look at the long lists of all of these fund .
who are you going to do with it ?
my fourth technology : premise for complexity .
it turns out that we can deal with more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to increase the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german explorer that gives you the opportunity to get your car completely even to get your car .
they have to make 62 different decisions to design their car completely .
now these decisions are different in the number of choices that they offer a decision .
and the car &apos;s car , the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , the gifts -- four possibilities .
so what i &apos;m doing now is , i change the order of the decisions .
half of the customers is going to be about the many possibilities , 56 , the low possibilities .
the other half of the customers is about the low possibilities , four visitors , to the 56 of the 56 , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
how interested in it .
if you &apos;re constantly using the most successful in the decision , it means that they &apos;re overwhelmed , and i &apos;m losing them .
what you find is that people who go from the many to the low , and again , choose to choose the most little .
we lose them .
go from the little choices to the many , then you stay in this .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i did is to change the order of this information .
when i start with the simple , i learn how to do it .
even though the smartest the smartest , i don &apos;t tell me about my preferences at the interior , it &apos;s still going to pick me on .
it also puts me in excitement about the great product that i &apos;m going to get to , and i &apos;m ready to be interested in interest with interest .
let me summarize .
i told you about four techniques that the problem of the brain &apos;s head -- just -- will be the surplus alternatives ; they &apos;re going to do it real -- we can do better with more categories , less possibilities .
each of these techniques i &apos;m going to describe you today is to help you to manage the possibilities -- good for them , you can use them for themselves , good for people who are feeding service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re in the choice .
and the more we &apos;re choosing , the better we will be able to practice art .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin , i &apos;m a rock , in youtube , and i look at youtube .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are going to be a paper , and then , why that is important at all .
we all want to be stars -- the singer , singers , criticism -- as i was young , it seemed infinitely difficult .
but the most important thing is that we can all be mad , and all of our creative activities can be mad in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet until the next saturday .
but at youtube , more than 48 hours of video a minute .
it &apos;s just a tiny percentage of this , and it &apos;s ever seen thousands of times and looked at thousands of times .
so how does this work ?
three things : the most , more , the unexpected and unexpected .
well , we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
whoa !
and the most , more , more , the .
last year , the last year , the video of this video was filmed , which he filmed in front of his house in the middle park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this chart shows how it looked at the video last summer for the first time .
actually , no viral video wanted to do a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing that , if you &apos;re going to be a long mountain mountain .
he had uploaded a lot of a lot of the things .
and this video was actually sent in january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jimmy &apos;s got a jimmy .
jimmy &apos;s singing the tweet , the video last last time .
because the way jimmy &apos;s a reminder of the way jimmy is going to give us new and interesting things and you show a big audience .
it &apos;s the friday , friday . it &apos;s going down to friday , and it &apos;s going down to friday , and it &apos;s the most remote thing to do , and friday , friday .
rs : &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was almost 200 million times .
so the graph looked like this .
just like &quot; double &quot; it seems to be not being .
what &apos;s happening in this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also more likely .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , the most , more , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson was a first one who was a first one who was doing twitter on twitter .
and it &apos;s important that a single person or group of a group of the world &apos;s a point of view , with a big audience , divided and accelerated with the process .
then this community was formed by people who shared this big joke , and they started talking about it and to come to play .
now there &apos;s 10,000 times of &quot; friday &quot; at youtube .
in the first seven days , there was a kind of a finite machine for every single day .
unlike the most of the time , the participation of the 20th century is the participation of the community , and we &apos;re either going to be part of this phenomenon -- either by making it spread or something new .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; is animation and music in the world .
this is , just simple .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
and if you hold that for crazy , you would know that there &apos;s a kind of a little bit of a time that was seen four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats that look at this video .
important is that creativity , which is in the world &apos;s most important and geeks .
there were acoustics .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole thing taken out of the ground that it made from a stupid joke to something that we can all participate on .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure at something , we &apos;re doing .
who could have been able to disagree with it ?
who would have been able to predict &quot; double &quot; or rebecca black or &quot;
what are you able to write , you can write that in which this is what the most powerful ?
in a world , in which every minute two days of video is uploaded to video , just really unique and unexpected , like the writing videos .
i &apos;m not very interested in that , i was not very interested in my friend , i &apos;m going to look at this great video , about a guy who &apos;s in new york against the passenger district .
i got a ticket , because i &apos;m not on the most , but often there &apos;s disabilities that are not going to go to the most beautiful thing .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s completely surprising and frustrating , casey &apos;s fun idea , and his argument is five million times .
this approach is true for everything we do .
and that &apos;s all leads us to a big question ...
what does this mean ?
and the most , more .
what does this mean ?
and the creative , creative , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture , to each access to each access and the audience .
as said , one of the biggest stars -- justin antonelli -- did his beginning at youtube .
nobody needs to give your ideas green light .
and today we &apos;re all feeling as owners as a owners of our culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media and they &apos;re not going to meet the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the connection between women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of this connection is in the life of a four year-old sister , and the day , in a little boat , was a feature of the day , and i was not going to be a little bit of a little boat in the chinese ocean . a feature of a little bit of a little bit of the time in the chinese ocean .
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still going to be put together .
i want to tell you about some of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the things .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man who &apos;s all life of the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
hold it in the front of the womb in the front of the world , like he must tell you that his life had been a single waste .
the words , so long his friends , now , the way his friends , the way .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgotten me to be forgotten .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the story was really trying to bend us , but we &apos;re drawn to it .
the next puzzle shows how a boat in the early world &apos;s early , quiet .
my mother may be 18 , when her father died -- already in a computer marriage , with two little girls .
for you , it had a job to put her a job : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely turned out that they could fail .
after a four and a half , a boat , a boat , is silent to the lake , as a result of the ocean .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear of the voices had been , rape and death .
as most adults on the boat , my mother was wearing a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
in a sense of a , i had just my sister and i , then you &apos;re sleeping and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the minimum of the engine , clapping of a wave on the bug , the big and empty horizon .
i remember the pirates that came up with many times , but from the men &apos;s most , and the most of the men in our boat were going to be parked , or the motor of the engine , the six hours didn &apos;t want to start .
but i remember the lights of the world &apos;s lights , and the young man , who broke up and died , was too much for him , and the taste of the first , the first one i had on the platform .
no apple ever tasted this .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in sacramento .
and the next thing is , the next thing is about four women in three generations that are going to build a new life .
we went down in the bottom of the world , one of the most popular , the population of the world &apos;s population , which is the population of the world .
unlike the most , in the world &apos;s most unknown , their existence was completely unknown , there was no more a more of the time .
the smell of the world came from the rest of the world .
and the most broken broken system were been between people who had a thing in common , and they started to have new .
my mother worked on farms , then on a line in a line of a year , six days , twice layers .
it was kind of going to find the time to find english and the most of the time .
we were poor .
every dollar was raised and became in another education for english and mathematics , no matter what to get to that . mostly the new things that came from second hand .
two of the stores for school , every one to cover the holes in the other .
a more of the time to the most remote , because they had to have six years .
and there were the rare but painful , but there &apos;s a toxic thing , and there &apos;s a lot of the time , &quot; the asian , go home . &quot;
after home ?
something more like me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a calm voice , &quot; i &apos;m going to go from the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted , but we told each other , but we told each other about our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered on the boat from the boat .
and it was my job , every night awake , to stay awake until her nightmares came to get them .
she opened a computer , then it made a business and opened a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t have the change , angry and the children , and they were trapped between two worlds .
loans and the humanities were looking at .
centers were built .
i lived in the world .
in one , i was the classic asian student who was the most , the most of the time .
in the other hand , i was involved in insecure life that carries the tragic scars of violence , the most devastating and the fda .
but so many of the years of help .
and because of this help i became a young year of the year of the year , as a young boy of the year .
and i was going to be able to get off a computer for the next , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous , was now tan le , refugee and social activist , who was invited to places that they never heard , and in the homes , they never had imagined .
i didn &apos;t know with the mystic .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the most remote .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the comfort of the life of an unknown , a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who were living in their days , and we &apos;re still telling them three times in the same bed .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old as you had to climb the boat .
no one was never a way .
&quot; do it just &quot; , she said . &quot; and it &apos;s not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about the most of the time , and education , and the turning of the world &apos;s .
and the open i talked about , the more i should tell you .
i met people in all the most different , so many of you did what they loved , lived on the limits of the possible .
and even though i had my degree , i realized i could not be able to get a career in law .
there had to be another more of the other more than a different .
and i realized the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a hint , a more , new , new , new , but not just what you need to be grateful , maybe a gift of the world &apos;s .
because the way that we can do is make the gravitational collapse of the horizons , so easily , that you can be accepted the assumptions of the environment .
i went from my favorite to know , to know that , yes , the world , but not as you &apos;re doing it .
possibilities that wouldn &apos;t have been allowed to be encouraged .
there was a energy , a spontaneous optimism , a strange soup of humility and the most of the time .
so i followed my brain .
i collected a little team of people to go to the box of the box , &quot; not a challenge of a challenge . &quot;
a year , we didn &apos;t have a cent .
at the end of a single bullet , i cook a huge amount of soup that we shared .
we worked late to the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant , and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull in the united states .
after just one journey .
my head again .
three months later , i moved and the adventure went on .
before i leave the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up to a time in the world &apos;s social norm and the local of the local person .
life has not changed for centuries .
her father died short after her birth .
her mother moved her alone .
with 17 , she was the second woman of a student who was proposed to mother .
without support of your husband , she was worried for a big , by having a big , and he was in their own case , and a bigger big , as they won .
&quot; don &apos;t go &quot; turned out .
i just in a hotel hotel in sydney , when she died . 1,000 miles away in sacramento .
i looked through the most remote and looked at it on the other side .
i knew she came to go to the end .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in a buddhist temple and sat around her .
we told her stories and admiration , that we were still at her .
to midnight , the monk came and said he was going to close the proscenium .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve been holding them tomorrow for today , &quot; he said .
&quot; they don &apos;t cut them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s going through the women .
you see who we were and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men who were maybe in our lives , were in the grim .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i think i &apos;m still thinking about the boat .
who would ever be one wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , the ease of the , before .
can i give you a bug in your life , who &apos;s courageous everybody &apos;s bold , the most courageous , the most devastating , the amount of the motor , the long one ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and you could be sure , i would do it .
and also , the mother &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or five series .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it at all photography ?
because that &apos;s of course a picture that you can &apos;t take with his camera .
yet , my interest started to photography when i got my first digital digital , in age 15 years old .
i put it with my former preference , but it was a little different , because the camera was actually in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you press the trigger .
so for me , it seemed like photography , so it was more about being the right place to be the right place .
i thought everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that &apos;s beginning to start when the trigger is going to be .
photographs like this : a construction site along a much more powerful road .
but it has an unexpected gap .
and yet , a realistic level .
or photos like this -- dark and the same , but all of the shared goal , a realistic level .
if i say reality , i &apos;m going to be a lot of the time .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can actually capture , but i want to look at it as if you could have that , you know , on a photograph .
photographs where you have to think a short moment to find the trick .
so it &apos;s more about capture an idea , as a moment .
what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what does the illusion create ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but the last thing is , what we &apos;re going to interpret is how we can interpret the world , and how they can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we &apos;re doing for realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see you as a puzzle of reality , which you can take different pieces and put together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect principles here , which we can identify all of us in a three-dimensional world .
but in a particular way , they can create something that looks like it &apos;s still a three-dimensional , and it might be a little bit of three-dimensional than it might exist .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so we &apos;re approaching our brains , because our brain is not being accepted that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combine pictures .
it &apos;s really about combine different realities .
so the things that are realistic to look at a picture , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things that we &apos;re doing around us .
but if we combine photographs , it really matters to think about it because otherwise you &apos;re just wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a realistic outcome .
as you can see , it &apos;s not three special images .
but together , you can combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that worms should have the same perspective .
second , these are the same photos of the same .
and these two images meet these two demands -- from the same altitude , and the same thing .
third , it &apos;s impossible to make it possible to make the individual images and end by using them by putting them into the face .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photo was actually placed .
so by putting color , contrast and the philippines of the edges , the individual , the individual , the host of the imagery , like the , and the disorders of the other , and we can see the limits between the different images , even though a picture is basically hundreds of levels , even though a picture is basically hundreds of levels of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that it &apos;s just a landscape , and the bottom part of the bottom is manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely covered in the process of photos from different places .
i personally think that it &apos;s easier to create a place , to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to take a compromise with the ideas in its head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew i needed several months to make them plan to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on a computer system .
the bank comes from another place .
the most of the time comes from a banker .
and yes , i even have the house on the island of red to look at it .
so to get a realistic outcome , it &apos;s going to be made out of planning .
i always start with a act of a culture .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s every piece of a lot of a little bit .
and if you make good footage , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
so , there are all the tools , and the only thing that we &apos;re limited is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic people are failing .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve introduced to the most of the time was , a more of the time .
it &apos;s not particularly scientifically , you &apos;re not working in a cup of coffee , or tea , and the patient , the patient , families , relatives , &quot; how does it go ? &quot;
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all of the electronic ones are failing : because we stopped listening to listening .
this is my favorite thing . a very simple thing .
she has a button , / it .
and every morning i &apos;ll go .
and yes , i have a task , like you might recognize .
i have my job in 95 pounds .
it &apos;s just working , every time i go to the scale , you send my data to google health .
and they &apos;re also going to be from my favorite territory , so he can see where my favorite , and it &apos;s not just in the moment i &apos;m going to support or so , but also with a look at the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you know that , i have about 4,000 , in twitter .
so every morning i &apos;ll go to my favorite and people talking about me before i sit in the car , &quot; to lunch , &quot; for lunch , just a little bit of a different , more , a little bit of a little bit . &quot;
but this is the most important thing that can happen because this is the pressure pressure , pressure pressure , to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could be patients .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and they bring them to a certain game to play their health better .
and the next week comes on to the market .
it will give you this little little bit of a little bit of a time that you &apos;re going to be in a iphone or so .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure , to send it to their doctor and for example , for example , to share with another more than 100 dollars .
and that &apos;s what patients come into play . they can &apos;t just take control of the control , captain on their own ship , but we can also help us in health care of the challenges , and so on .
do you make ways to use that , and they &apos;re starting to hug with this , patients in the team .
and that can reach through these kinds of ways , but also through the more unequal .
and one of the things we did is i want to share with you with a quick video .
we all have the most of our cars in our cars .
maybe in our mobile phones .
we know exactly where all of the things around the world are around .
we know one where all the stations are .
and clear , we can find a lot of things .
but where would the next thing to help that patient ?
we have a lot of the time , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next calorie of the next epic was in this moment .
so , what did we do ? we did it in the netherlands .
we &apos;ve built a website and asked a crowd , &quot; if you see a computer , please share with us where he &apos;s , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , of course , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , of course .
and over 10,000 , they &apos;ve been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find apps for this .
and we &apos;ve created a more of the time .
we &apos;ve developed an app for a long time , extended reality to find these kinds of things .
and if you &apos;re in a city like a city , and somebody can get out , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks you &apos;re going to save your own , to find the next one .
and we don &apos;t want to just do this as a result of the product , like the product , but also to bring a more than a more of the time .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues all over the world , from other universities , to help us behave like the way to behave , to make these kinds of things on the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation , and somebody &apos;s going to be careful , it &apos;s your own unconscious or somebody else , you can find a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a way .
the other thing we want to ask is that companies are going to help us all the world in the world .
these could be the most important , or technicians for example , just to ensure that the most important thing is still on his location .
please help us and try and make it not just better , but to take the hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the world &apos;s most .
and my little favorite , we want to force us to force the environment by doing ...
... it &apos;s the more likely attention .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take it to be shy of it .
now -- we can just skip that -- i &apos;m going to just skip the video ...
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
and the most is ...
oh , my time is already over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design , a year to take a year , and in a environment that is so much , which is what they &apos;re actually hate , we &apos;ve been working in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the most of the time for the rift .
we choose some fellows every year and we &apos;re working with a lot of the offspring .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them into the world .
and there they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what you really do is show what &apos;s possible today with technology .
so you meet al .
al is a more of the city in boston .
here it looks like he looks for a date , but what he really looks like is someone who &apos;s going to be a little bit of it when he &apos;s a , he &apos;s not very good in the most remote time when he &apos;s from a meter .
how did he look at this particular kind of help ?
we had a team of explanations in boston in boston , which is the code for america .
they were there in february , and it has a lot of the last february .
and they realized that the city never is the fire fire .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik &apos;s , noticed something else , and that was that the residents are free to get the sidewalks , right before these parts .
so he did what everybody would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can delete a fire fire .
you &apos;re going to get to it to the way it &apos;s going to be .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game game .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of 21 apps that have written the fellows in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t make other people &apos;s .
they &apos;re expanding fast .
there &apos;s this guy in the world &apos;s city , which is the city that he could use that app , not for snow , but that &apos;s what citizens are going to deny .
it &apos;s very important that these are the most important things that are working , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use app to get the citizens to clean the people &apos;s citizens .
and chicago has just introduced them to the people who are the most popular , when it &apos;s going on .
we know nine cities now that plan to use this app .
and she has more prevalent , organic , of course .
if you know something about the most of you , you know that it &apos;s not going to be like this .
the way that you &apos;re going to get the software is a few years .
we had a team that was working last year in boston , for three people , for three months .
it was about a method , with the parents , which are the right public schools for their children .
and we said , later , when it was going to go over the normal channels , it took over two years and it had cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing else .
there &apos;s a project right now in the california , which has been cost to the most much billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so a app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spreading from the most of the time , and it &apos;s a kind of shot of the bug on the institution of government .
she shows how government could work better -- not more like a private company , like many people think they should .
and not even like a computer , but it &apos;s more like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , it &apos;s a new generation represents the problem of the government -- not as the problem of a life institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out that we &apos;re very good at the collective act with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make tools that we need to do things effectively in common .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; there are hundreds of people all over the country , which are up and write the other day in their own communities .
they don &apos;t have given the government .
they &apos;re dreadful frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , fix them .
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all have your feelings about politics and the snake and all the other things that we really are hungry , is government , in the core of tim o , &quot; what we &apos;re doing . &quot;
today , a lot of people have given government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i &apos;m going to ask you that you &apos;re going to change it because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; government is in change .
and because the government eventually is taking their strength -- they &apos;re like , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- how we think about how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government than i started this program .
and how many people , i thought it &apos;s mostly about choosing people in a office .
now , after two years , i &apos;ve come to the end that it &apos;s all about communities to go to communities .
this is the call for service and information .
you usually come out , if you &apos;re in your town , you &apos;re usually going to change .
if you &apos;ve ever had the chance to work in your urban urban museum , how our fellow scott &apos;s part of the program -- in fact , do it , you &apos;re doing that , you know , the people who are the government , including a lot of different problems , including the government .
so scott gets this kind of thing .
he &apos;s called &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the most remote .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors into your house and play very accurate music , and see if the livestock is the livestock ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the world &apos;s end .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call .
it has an app , a more of a sudden , and the most remote , called &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work very clever people in the office of the new urban system in boston .
one day -- this is a real report -- it came in , &quot; i &apos;m in my online room . &quot;
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scott : from human beings to human beings .
but on &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is all public , &quot; that everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post we have was , &quot; i went over there , found the remote control behind the house .
and the way ? yes .
turned the remote line on the side . went home .
good night , sweet . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . this is the digital digital .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how government is in the meaningful .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i &apos;m not necessarily a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m talking more about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government was playing a central role .
they were connected to these two people .
and you could have created them with government performance , if these were needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if a neighbor helps the other to help us , we &apos;re going to do our communities .
let &apos;s call the most of the money , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things that we have to think about is that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that it &apos;s a input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is that .
how often have we chosen a political leader -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy using a new political leader -- and then we &apos;re going to go back and we &apos;re expecting the government to reflect our values , and then we have changed , and then we have changed our needs , and then we don &apos;t have changed our needs , and then we have changed , and then we have changed our needs , and then we don &apos;t have changed our needs , and then we don &apos;t have changed our needs ,
that &apos;s because the government is a further ocean , and politics is the top of the top .
and what is below is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with these contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we have , and we pay to pay something that is working against us , something else , and then we &apos;re going to get ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want that institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real thing is happening .
we need to get to the wiring of government .
so the most , the most , has done it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of fun citizens written a very detailed report , which is a answer to the most sophisticated , which is the answer to the most remote .
that &apos;s not political , that &apos;s active .
now , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time that we &apos;re thinking about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we &apos;re going to reach what we need to do without improving the institution that can act in the name of all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of government is fundamentally , in a way , which can actually reach something by doing the society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the internet , and the white internet is , it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the only systems .
now the average age of our offspring is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up with the voice of granted .
they don &apos;t fight this fight that we all fight , that &apos;s what you &apos;re talking about , all of you can talk .
you can make your opinion , to every channel , and you do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care so much about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that are improved the work of the government .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
that could be , a fire fire , to deny a garbage trash , a trash switch with a plastic switch .
and sure , we would have these fire fire all the time , and many people do that .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we don &apos;t just have consumers to pay the government and get the benefits .
we are more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all got here : if it &apos;s about the great , important things we have to do together , all together , we &apos;re going to be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually , i think , to explain , the people like wonderful technologies , which are the emergence of the emergence , are going to be . and i thought , there &apos;s a lot of friends that are going to happen to be so quickly , and i &apos;m trying to see what &apos;s going on .
i &apos;m going to start to show you a single boring slide .
... you know , you could be able to show the slide .
this is a slide that i &apos;ve been selected from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but it &apos;s very about the general form .
this slide shows data of a analysis of the performance of the performance of the brain , compared to the performance of a global area .
the interesting here is that this slide , like some other , which we often find in our field , is a kind of a second curve .
with other words , every step here is a power of a power in the world .
and that &apos;s a novelty that we need to use this guy on the field of the technology in technology .
something very strange happened here .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the light back .
something else , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper here .
now , why do we draw graphics in the technology on the technology ?
the reason i would draw it is when i would draw it on a normal curve where , we say that this is the years , so the timeline of a kind of thing , and this is a lower market of technology that i want to represent with a graph , then the graph is silly .
and then you see .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , we &apos;ll say a little bit of a time , then that would be very irrational in the form of the body .
but if something like this happens here , it changes the main conditions .
so if the most fast thing that the most fast thing that the most fast progression would be like , then we could get a taxi in a taxi and in 30 seconds , we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not that fast .
there was never before in history before the story of the world &apos;s history , this kind of kind of kind of data , which is the scale of all the few years .
the question i want to ask you is if you look at this exponential curves , you &apos;re not going to go to it forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is always going to be and forever as fast as now .
there are two options : there are two options .
either it &apos;s going to be a classic of the classic , like this , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
this is about it .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in the way that it &apos;s going to happen .
it &apos;s really like that , we &apos;re in the middle of a transition in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition of the world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask and i also have to be a lot of myself , is that the new world will be ?
what is this new state that &apos;s going to take the world slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing to be in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , the future was somewhere in 2000 and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future and you &apos;re stuck in the future of the future .
and we &apos;re not going to go .
so in other words , the future is taken to a year since i &apos;m in this world .
i think that &apos;s the reason that we realize that there &apos;s something in the way that it &apos;s happening .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
and we know that now , just not to try to see a sense of 30 or 50 years in the future because everything is going to be so different that a simple set of things we &apos;re doing now .
so i want to talk about what that might be , that transition in the we are now .
to do this , i &apos;ll talk about some other things , which really nothing with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we have to go back to a step and look at the thing on a longer .
and i want to look at this on the stairwell of the earth .
i think the picture makes sense , if you split it into some of the most remote .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s 2.5 billion years . the earth was a big , a lot of the way that they were doing , in many ways , they were filled with chemicals .
so if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized , we have a pretty good picture about how they &apos;re the most good thing .
i also believe it &apos;s theories that start to understand how everything started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a very compelling story of that , which is that this time , little cell spills of the chemicals .
some of these oil spills contain a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from outside and growing .
all the ones that were started to be started .
these little oil spills were the most primitive most primitive .
but these oil spills weren &apos;t about alive in the sense of the senses , because every single one was just a little , fuzzy recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , the most important thing is to make chemicals more stable .
so every graffiti was a little different .
in fact , the lucifer , which had a for growth , had been more than other than others and more integrated and more chemicals and more chemicals .
so this is what we &apos;re doing to survive longer and they &apos;re expanding in the field of scale .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting it is , if these axes learned a trick about abstraction .
in any way , which we don &apos;t really understand , these artifacts have to be able to make information .
they &apos;ve learned the recipe of the cell as information , and that &apos;s in a certain chemical form that we call dna .
and with other words , they have found a way of found , evolutionary ways , which allowed them to be able to be able to be able to be stored with this information and copied it .
the amazing thing about it is that this kind of information is going to store information over time , which is the same thing that she was born .
in fact , the recipe is for us , which is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same kindle .
and that &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s used in the same , and the same code .
we &apos;re far that we can only write , just to the most , even in this code .
and i have 100 of the white ones here , which i &apos;m trying to keep in airports from the world &apos;s airports .
it &apos;s -- what i did is i took this code -- the code is from normal letters , which we use to be able to use -- and i &apos;ve written my business on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve been writing it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if somebody wants to do a hundred million copies of my business model , i have enough for everyone in this room and even for everyone on this world , and it &apos;s right here .
i would have been in fact a kind of a kind of a time , and i would have written them in a virus and published in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna of dna was a more interesting step .
and the most of these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened , very interesting step , which was completely different , and that cells started to communicate and exchange information , so communities from cells came from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
that &apos;s why the reason to keep antibiotics is growing .
some bacteria have found how they can stay from penicillin and they have this information together with other bacteria in the dna and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate each other .
this communication allowed the reasons of communities , which were in a very sense of the same boat ; they were the most powerful .
so they either survived together , or they went together , and they went together . that meant that if a community was successful , all individuals were increasingly repeated in the community and the evolution of evolution .
now the most , the most , is where these communities are so close to the fact that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community in a computer .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
and at that point , we have a parallel communities , communities of many of the most many of the things that are going together as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind .
we have a lot of cells that are not asked to be asked .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started to develop that , so that the level , which was the evolution of evolution , wasn &apos;t the only cell , but the whole thing we call organism .
the next step happened within this communities .
the most successful thing started to abstract information .
and they developed special structures which didn &apos;t make anything else than information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the most powerful ones that have built these kinds of things .
they started to train specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and that &apos;s what information is .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of this communities .
and this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point , a individual -- learning in the time of a single organism , instead of the evolutionary time .
so , a organism could learn to be a certain multinational , because they didn &apos;t have to eat and made it sick , the last time he ate her .
so this was going to happen within the lifespan of a single organism , whereas before hundreds of thousands of years , because these information had to be influenced by the individuals , which died because of these fruit , because these are not there .
so the nervous system has the system of this particular thing , because evolution could now be within a single place .
she could be in a time of a time .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
and as an example , the most important thing that we know is the human language , the human language .
it &apos;s a fairly amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , very complicated , and i &apos;m excited about my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and you &apos;re basically taking sound of sound , in hope to create a similar idea in your head , which has a certain firewall with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , it changes in sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of other people .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we have humanity , is we started talking to success .
we go through the same stages , which have gone through the way -- the abstraction of our methods , how we &apos;re going to hold data , to present .
the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
and the computer , computers , the , , the , , and so on , are all our busy mechanisms that we built in our community to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also to develop faster than we were .
now , evolution can happen in time in time .
you &apos;ve also seen a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a evolution where he showed a little bit of evolution in the &quot; the &quot; program &quot; program .
so we have the most important thing to do .
the first steps of history , which i told you , a billion years a piece of a piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , are drawn some hundred million years .
then the steps , like language and so on , is less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to take a few decades .
the process of itself is feeding itself and will be , i think , the word is the word for this -- if something is its favorite .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explosion of the graph .
we see the process that feed itself .
i live from building computers and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism i use to build computers , not using the way that we have a recently , not a recently , in computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design this in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor in the world &apos;s power is doing .
it has billions of people .
what i do instead , and what the designers are doing is to make the designers , we think of a certain kind of a lot of a little bit , and the machine makes it happen , and the machine is going to make it happen .
and it &apos;s partly doing it with ways that we don &apos;t even understand that .
a method that is particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been using in the last time is evolution itself .
we put a more of the way in the machine that &apos;s going on in the machine .
to call a example of the most extreme cases , we can create a program which evolved from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , &quot; please , a hundred million things , the little little bit of things .
now , all of these are all the elected instructions , all of the programs , and then , eventually , the programs , and eventually , the ones that my actions are on the next . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to type numbers , that would be a simple example of which i &apos;ve been using for this .
so find programs that can be kind of possible to be able to do that .
of course , the chance of being elected instructions is very small that they &apos;re kind of a chance of chance , so probably not the instructions that are going to do this .
but one of those things like something happiness is to go back to the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences that my processing is the next thing .
and the rest of these , the rest of the rest .
now all of the most remote ones that have the numbers in the best .
and that &apos;s with a method of the world &apos;s way , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their own , and the children are the characteristics of the two programs of the two programs .
so i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that come to the processing of the processing of the things that are more likely to do .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
and they &apos;re again .
maybe some mutations might be a few mutations .
and try to do this again with another generation .
all these generations need just few milliseconds .
and so i can let a evolution over millions of years in the computer , or in more complicated cases , some hours .
finally , i get programs that can be able to be perfect .
the fact is , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write from hand .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s devastating and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure you do the job because they come from a series of the programs , which have done the job .
because your life was going to be the job of whether they did the job right .
i sat in a 747 with the cosmologists , and he was a map of the foyer , and he says , &quot; oh look at it . look at this .
there &apos;s this plane from the airplane , which is the work of the work that works together to make their flight safer . &quot;
we know that a computer &apos;s not confined to it if it &apos;s too complicated .
so we start leaving on computers , for a process which is different from classical engineering .
he allows us to make things a lot higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
and yet we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it yet .
so , we &apos;re going to take the technology .
we use these programs to make a lot faster , so we can be able to do this processes faster .
so it &apos;s going to get a kind of a more .
it &apos;s going to be faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems like this .
because all these new technologies of today are feeding themselves .
we raise off .
we &apos;re at a point that is analog to the most analog , as a result of the world &apos;s .
so we &apos;re the most , and we can &apos;t do that , and we can &apos;t do what hell is to do here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this kind of thing .
but i really believe that after us , after us , something is coming .
i think it &apos;s very much to say that we are the final of evolution .
and i think we all are part of the creation of what &apos;s going on as next .
now , lunch is before and i think i &apos;m going to hear this now before i &apos;m going to be more likely to get more .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert with the sky with a lot of the time .
we talked about that nothing has changed for the ancient indian , &quot; tembererana . &quot;
if we wanted to travel indians at the time , we were going to go into a car and a car .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
and then , when the big indian was in the world , he took a bow , he took a bow in the floor and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with a lot of the things , and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that was really sad .
i got something scared of technology .
it was scared that i could lose the ability to enjoy the dawn without camera , without tweet , and without tweet .
i found that technology should make magic , and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather was my little silver .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most popular thing for me .
she was a more of the access to a world full of pirates and the images of the ships in my imagination .
i came to dream as we were going to kill our clocks and cameras of it .
they were inspired by us .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic instead of killing magic instead .
with 16 , i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device , the readers on the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s going to bring images and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
storytelling always took more senses .
but what do we do with this ?
i &apos;m just going to go to a lot of a interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s , &quot; take your finger on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s , &quot; this box is heard ... &quot; i write my name .
and from me , a character is going to be in the book .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad knows by gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the child in me is really excited about this opportunity .
i talked much about magic .
i don &apos;t mean a magician and the dragon , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i always found .
so you have to get the ipad down here and the fireflies .
and the light light through the rest of the book .
another idea that was fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single more mild .
and so here &apos;s a little bit of a book , and every world is a little bit more powerful that i &apos;m going to put here on the magic machine .
and this opens a map .
and the whole thing was already maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows and it &apos;s going to be able to get to the rest of the book .
it &apos;s also a little bit of other places .
i &apos;m going to go here .
it &apos;s important to me , to make something that is a lot of the time that it &apos;s also very much more powerful .
this is the most powerful .
we &apos;ve all heard of the most of the most of the time and the most , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , who the most remote ?
the poor was caught thousands of years in the suburbs , in a old book book .
and we bring them back , in an contemporary story for children .
a story that &apos;s been done with new issues , like the most of the time .
the theme of the world &apos;s subject , a big problem of the last 10 years is that children are sitting in their rooms , without running away .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search of a search , and you have to go out and collect the camera of the hallway of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of the world &apos;s collections , rocks , and the shells .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do more .
this is going to be brought up . you have to go out to make a photograph of a flower , and mark .
in another chapter you have to highlight a piece of a piece of water and mark .
so you actually create a digital collection of photos that you can put online .
a child in london shows the picture of a computer and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities that are the world and technology to connect together .
in the next book , we plan a interaction that you use the video of the hallway , and through adaptive reality , a animation of the house is going to appear on a plant before the house .
on a place , the screen is going to go to leaves .
you have to do the sound of the brain , you throw and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the forces of technology are closer and in the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and we &apos;re closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in the middle of the classroom , prisons or a half .
i spend most of my time with social weakest in the world &apos;s most social and places that there are very much despair .
here at ted , to see , and listen to how cowboys that is , i &apos;ve given a lot of power .
in the short time , i was a clear one : ted has a identity .
you can tell things the world &apos;s impact .
and sometimes , if something about ted comes , it gets a meaning and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher have meaning , but the words of a dedicated teacher are particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t have to learn that in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional computer household , which was dominated by a mat , and this is my grandmother .
she was a kind of a strong woman , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every single room .
she was also the starting of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a computer of a computer .
their parents were born in the womb in virginia as a slave .
she was born in the northwest field and the experience of slavery was very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also called a lot of the way .
when i met them as a young boy , she came to me and i went to my prayer .
they made me so morally that i could barely breathe . then she went to me .
one or two hours later , if i came to her , she came to me and said , &quot; do you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; i said , &quot; no , i said , &quot; yes , i said , &quot; yes , she was going to calm me into quiet .
and she was something that was made that you wanted to be near her .
the only problem that was that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes , when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention to their attention .
my cousins went around .
i remember , i have to be eight or nine , i was going to woke up one morning and went into the room . all my cousins went around .
my grandmother sat at the end of the room and i was at the end of the room .
first , i thought that this was a game .
i saw her and smiles , but she looked very serious .
this was so 15 or 20 minutes , and then she stood up and came to me . she took me on hand and said , &quot; come on , and i have to talk , we have to talk . &quot;
i remember it as if it was yesterday .
i &apos;m never going to forget it .
she took me out to go out and said , &quot; i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t have to be a lot of it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; i said , &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to see that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re a little bit special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;m never going to forget that .
then she said , &quot; you have to promise three things , &quot; i &apos;m going to promise . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i &apos;m going to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby and you have to be with promise that you &apos;re always going to care about it . &quot;
i think my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , that &apos;s going to be me . &quot;
then she said , &quot; next of the time , i &apos;m going to be able to do the right thing . &quot; even if it falls , the right thing is to do . &quot;
i thought , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
finally she said , &quot; the last thing you need to promise me is that you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south and i have a brother who is older , and a year old sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this kind of a beer to grabbed my sister and i went to the forest .
we just put it around as well as otherwise .
then he took a drink of beer and offered my sister , and she took me , and then she offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . you know , no . i don &apos;t want to do beer . &quot;
my brother said , well , we &apos;re doing it , we &apos;re doing it , but you &apos;re also doing everything we do .
i had what , your sister had what . go , a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . do you just do it . &quot;
my brother was at the point .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , what &apos;s going on . &quot;
then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t always do you crazy because of the conversation with grandma ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what do you talk ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma all the grandchildren , that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was destroyed at the ground .
i &apos;m going to tell you something .
i should not do that .
this is maybe going to be public .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m going to be a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s a lot of the time that i &apos;m going to be . i say identity is power .
if we create the right way of identity , we can tell people around us , which you don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they could not .
of course my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they &apos;re a special thing .
my grandfather was during the prison in prison .
my uncle died in the world disease .
and she believed that this is the themes that we need to care about .
i tried to say something about our system system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1992 , 300,000 people were in the middle of the prison and prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest population rates of the world .
seven million people are left on the side of the way or with them with them .
i think i think we have changed our world fundamentally .
in social weak and black parts of the population , despair and despair , because of this changes .
one of three male black black black black black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , in the middle of the country , or with the remote .
in urban communities everywhere , in the country -- from los angeles , in hiroshima , baltimore -- 50 to 60 percent of all black young men , in prison , in prison , or with the remote , or with remote .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have been able to do with the most remote , it &apos;s also being fed by poverty .
we have a system system that you have to treat a lot better when they &apos;re rich and guilty as poor and innocent .
wealth , not a ride , affects the result .
yet we seem to be very happy to be .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a few of the things that are there .
my home in alabama are fixed to you , if you &apos;re being convicted of it .
here and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population is fixed to her .
we &apos;re going to predict that in 10 years the percentage of the most primitive of the sensory system will be so high as the most dramatic of the world &apos;s most common .
the silence is a lot of the silence .
i represent kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , the most remote kids in the prison .
in this country , there are a lot of children working in the world &apos;s world without energy .
we &apos;ve been running a lot of process .
the only country of the world .
i represent people in the world .
the question of death is a interesting question .
we believe because you taught us that the real question is : does a human being made for a person to die for a of him ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think about it differently , depending on how we see our identity .
the other view is not : does anybody deserve a crime , but , do we make it , to kill ?
i find this fascinating .
the death penalty in america defined by error .
on nine people that we proved , one that we have been innocent , which was the one that was left and from death death .
an amazing thing . one of nine innocent .
i find this fascinating .
we would never let anyone fly with a plane when nine planes go , which is a crash .
but somehow we create it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking much about these questions .
i talk about race and the question if we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i was a student &apos;s story , i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , the time against the end of the protests , until the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for the senior , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to fear fear of the world .
or bombs .
it was fear of terror that was shaped her life .
these older people are now coming to me and say , &quot; mr , tweet , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re talking to people , you &apos;re going to stop saying that we should stop to do it for the first time in the history of our nation . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the pad and decades of the most passionate inspirational and dominance .
and yet , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what meaning our actions in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly going to get together .
we always create new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s not willing to be willing to be the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the mater is not to overcome the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve been given some talks in germany about death death .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing , you &apos;re talking about hearing . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany there are no death death .
and of course , it can never give you more . &quot;
it was very silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible to kill us for the systematic people .
it would be a lot of us , aware of ourselves , and people are going to be able to do it . &quot;
i thought about it .
as it feels , in a world , in the world , the german state people had been doing , especially when under the number of jews were a lot of jews .
it would be a lot of time .
it would be a lot of the time .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we &apos;re going to go to people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted of the death , 11 times higher when the victim is white .
and yet there &apos;s this mental inversion .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with that , with these difficult topics , the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities are going to be the realities of suffering , abuse , mastery .
i mean , it seems important to unite both .
because we finally talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to can be able to be able to be able to be in a complex world .
for me , it means to be a time to think about , and talk about the poor , the most glamorous , which never will be at ted .
but think about a kind of way that we &apos;re embedded in our own lives .
we all have to believe the things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re so rational , so we &apos;re very rational .
innovation , creativity , and development doesn &apos;t only come from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this kind of thing that i think you &apos;re going to take , not just to be open to all the light and the things that are also the dark and the dark and the dark .
ariel &apos;s , the great most big politicians , once said , has said .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe against oppression , we wanted everything to do , but what we needed most was hope , a mental credibility , the willingness to be the willingness to be in a very devastating place , and witness . &quot;
this mental sensitivity is the core of what i think that also is the most important thing to do for this .
there &apos;s no distinction to technology and design that allows us to be very , very , very , very , very long , and we don &apos;t have eyes for poverty , mastery and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity is very much more from us than if we don &apos;t care about it .
she &apos;s going to touch it deeply .
as a young lawyer , i &apos;m going to meet the great privilege .
and again , the woman was coming back to the day , where they were two of their oldest friends , and they were the older women who had organized the most , incredible warrior -- and virginia , a white , a white , a white , a white , a white , a white , a white , a white , a white , a white , a white , a white , a white , a white , a white , a white , a white , a white , a white , a white , a
so these women were going to be met and talked about it .
and then , to call the woman , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go , &quot; the woman , ms. parks in the city . we want to talk about .
do you want to listen to the middle and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and just heard .
it was always so inspiring , so that &apos;s how it was .
and one day i sat there and heard this women , and after a few hours , woman turned to me to tell us , &quot; well , you know , what the initiative is for same . &quot;
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to make a difference .
and the people want to help people who were innocent .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the world &apos;s .
we want to eliminate the world &apos;s world without energy .
we want to do something against death penalty .
we want to reduce the number of death rates .
we want to eliminate the way . &quot;
i thought my usual talk , and then she saw me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go . &quot;
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
and then woman was holding up to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why they need to be very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
and so i think that the ted ted should be .
we need to make ways to ask us this challenges : this problems , this excuse .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
i &apos;ve learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a few very simple things .
that we all are more than the worst thing we ever did .
i think that &apos;s true for every human being on the planet .
if someone lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t hear him , it &apos;s not just a indians .
even who kills someone &apos;s , is not just a murderer .
and because that &apos;s what &apos;s like , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that has to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with safety in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think too many places that are the opposite of poverty .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so , we &apos;re not going to be measured at the end of our technology , not in the way we &apos;re developing , not in our intellect and mind .
finally , a society is not measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and subtle and the other , as they deal with the poor , the main man .
because in this context , we &apos;re starting to understand the real amazing things that make us .
sometimes i lose the balance . a story to end .
sometimes i urge too much .
i &apos;m tired of how we all .
sometimes , more significant these ideas are ahead of our thinking , on very important way .
i represent these kids who were convicted of very hard brain .
i go to the most remote and visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and the as a adult in court .
then i wonder , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn someone into something that he &apos;s not ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night , i stayed on a long time , and i thought , my goodness , if a judge can turn us into something else , it has to have a lot of time .
right , the judge , the judge has a lot of the judge .
you should also be able to wish what .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think about it , i started working on a bill .
i had a 14 , poor black boy as clients .
and i started with this bill . the headline was , &quot; bill , my arms , 14 black clients like a privileged , white , &quot; to treat , &quot; to treat , &quot; and , &quot; to treat . &quot;
in my grandfather , i explained that leadership is the most of the time and the police and the police .
there was a crazy line about that in this country that there &apos;s nothing more disabled that there &apos;s only a pleasure .
the next morning i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i just dreamed of this crazy bill or actually written it .
and i didn &apos;t just have it , and i didn &apos;t just send him to the court .
a few months , and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided i was my god , i have to be able to put it into the court and this crazy case .
i went to the car and was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard to be so painful .
and finally , i went from my car and went up the staircase .
when i was the staircase to the court , there was a elderly , black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and i went to me .
then he pulled me into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched something very deep in me , identity , the ability every single one , to help a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i went to the most , the most .
once the judge looked at me , as soon as the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. assistant , did you put this crazy bill ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started arguing .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
i wrote this crazy stuff .
and the most , in the way , came in and the office workers and workers .
in the world &apos;s most , the most devastating thing was , the most angry ones were angry that we talked about skin skin language , over poverty , about inequality .
i looked at the janitors , and i went down .
he always looked back through the window and could hear the whole thing .
he went and down .
finally , this older black man came to a very , very much of the day in the world &apos;s most , and sat directly behind me , almost on the most remote .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
while the pause came in , a computer was born in the way that the janitors was in the most remote .
this is the most little one that ran over the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the world &apos;s ? &quot;
the older black man stood on . he saw the most , then he saw me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m a day to say that young man , you don &apos;t get the goal of the eyes . &quot; don &apos;t you go .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far more than the universe , but that it &apos;s justice .
that we &apos;re not completely developed as humans , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and the most remote .
that our survival of survival is associated with each individual .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and design , from entertainment and creativity , with humanity , pity and justice .
and i want to do that by you , which is that i &apos;m going to see that , just say , lose the goal of the eyes . don &apos;t give you .
they have seen this audience , this community , and you heard a obvious wish to help you and do something .
what can we do ?
and the way , you know , is , there &apos;s all possibilities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a kind of a time in this spring , which is that it &apos;s actually a effort to do something about the most of the most , something that &apos;s otherwise in politics .
here , in california , you &apos;re going to be a billion dollars for the death penalty system , a billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all the most remote of all the world &apos;s most of the most remote .
56 percent of all the world &apos;s own game are not coming .
there &apos;s the chance to do something .
this is the one that is going to suggest to the money in more more than the money and security .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the most powerful thing is the most powerful in america .
this is a fact that the fact is to be asked in a context with the increased .
what would you say someone who thinks ?
now , in fact , the number of the world &apos;s number is not very changed .
most of the most of the most important in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of the world &apos;s class .
it was the most devastating frog against drugs .
so the dramatic high numbers come to the prisoners .
we have a lot of the rhetoric of the misery of punishment .
now we have &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; of the people forever behind grid . &quot;
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a computer system , not less .
and i think our current is not helping anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
and they really have a string of a string of the way .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
thank you that you were at ted . thank you very much .
and i &apos;m a conservative basis of death .
two : famine in somalia . three : spray of police police .
four : the other thing .
six : social mode .
eight : the other .
different speakers : the mass mass .
recession . a lot .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but also the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative topics because our minds are going to get attention to this .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this .
every second every day , our senses start much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we don &apos;t have any more important than our survival , the first station for all the information is a part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early early , our favorite system .
it &apos;s going to be the whole information in the search of the search of the creation of danger in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old saying , &quot; if it &apos;s a lot of the demand , the demand is very true .
now , with all our digital devices that are seven days the week , 24 hours a day , the day , is not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that it &apos;s always worse .
but perhaps this is not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the enormous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century is made by a series of forces that it &apos;s going to be possible to create a world of the abundance of abundance .
well , i don &apos;t say we have a big problem -- climate crisis , water , water and energy energy -- we &apos;ve already got .
and as people are , we &apos;re much better at the time , but they &apos;re at the very long time .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , which has increased inflation &apos;s population .
child mortality has reduced a tenth .
and that &apos;s what the most important thing comes out , the most , more , a little bit of the time .
steve pinker has shown us that we &apos;re currently living in a very peaceful time of the world &apos;s life .
and according to charles , the most popular thing is the most 130 years of 25 percent of the past 25 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations constantly .
in fact , we have to redefine poverty .
remember , a big percentage of americans who live under poverty , access to electricity , water , toilets , toilets , the other , roads , air phones , air phones , air phones , air phones , air phones , air phones .
the richest play-doh of the last century , the most recent of the earth , would never have been able to dream these luxury .
the basis for a lot of these technologies , and these grow are growing .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool is going to be the information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the most , the 12 to 24 months .
so that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less and more than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
notice two things in this curve .
first , as smooth it is -- in good times , war or peace , and peace , depression and the way .
this is the result of faster computers , building faster computers .
it goes down for no one of our big problems .
and despite your logarithmic , you &apos;re going to go up on the left .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available all to be available .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; , &quot; something that my friends call &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how many of you have seen the victory from ibm supercomputer in &quot; risk &quot; ?
it was great .
i &apos;ve got the newspapers and looked for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson &apos;s closest opponent . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the language of language .
imagine that these artificial intelligence of every owner is available to each owner of a computer .
four years ago ray kurzweil started and i &apos;m a new university , which is called &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we bring our students all these technologies to the focus with special focus , like this , to solve the big challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students , businesses , products and services that are going to affect the lives of billions of people .
think about that , a group of students today can affect life from billions of people .
30 years ago , this would have ridiculous .
today we can put it on dozens of companies that have done this .
if i think of abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury , and i &apos;m not going to live with a life of the planet .
it &apos;s about creating abundance of goods .
and scarcity is a lot of the way , and technology is a resource of a resource force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of comparable , in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of the day to dinner .
and the soldiers got a lot of the soldiers , consistent self , was got a lot of time .
but the king of the world &apos;s king got a lot of the time .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , valuable than gold and spears .
this is why the dome of the computer &apos;s .
although aluminum &apos;s percent of the world &apos;s worth is , it doesn &apos;t matter as a pure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and the more .
but then the technology was developed , and then the technology was so cheap that we use it with our most powerful .
then let &apos;s put this analogy in the future .
we think today at the time .
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re going to live on a planet of the world &apos;s energy than we use year .
16 of the energy of energy all the time of all the time , all the time , all the time on the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is a problem .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time , the cost for solar costs to 50 percent of the most remote -- the two rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost for solar fell in the last year to 50 percent .
last month , this has published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the united states , solar consumption is going to cost six cents a million cents in the national average cost .
and if we have a dictator , we &apos;ll also have water in the surplus .
let &apos;s talk about the most of the time .
do you remember , as carl assange , the most , in 1990 , when it was on saturn , back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a car blue cpu . &quot;
because we live on a computer system .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s a percent of the percent of light , two percent of the ones are , and we fight to be permanently percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope .
and there &apos;s new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new of the way that we &apos;re going to go .
and from a conversation today with dean , a criminal innovators , i want to do this , i want to share with you -- he gave me the permission -- his favorite , the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the
it can produce a thousand gallons of clean drinking water per day -- whether water water , low-cost water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents per liter .
the president of coca-cola has just been able to start a big amount of a hundred units in developing countries .
and if everything goes good , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola will apply this technology globally in the entire planet .
this is a innovation of innovation that &apos;s today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
you &apos;re going to be my goodness , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 2013 .
remember , a computer phone with a cell phone in the middle of kenya is a better amount of a long time than president reagan .
and if you look at your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowing and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the surplus , like nobody ever could have predict .
and it &apos;s still better , which is the things that you have and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , and the photo , libraries of books , and the way that we &apos;re , literally , is literally more powerful in your cell phone .
and the best thing is , perhaps what &apos;s expected to us in health .
i had the pleasure of the pleasure , with the most , which is called the &quot; $ 10 million years of the x prize . &quot;
we &apos;re asking teams all over the world , all these technologies in a mobile cell that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s with ai , you can test it or test its own .
and to win , it needs to be a better diagnosis than a team of the doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of the most of the most promising and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
if this device is a kind of a device or a more , it &apos;s not known , it &apos;s called the health system , and it &apos;s a pandemic in front of your mind .
but now the biggest force that &apos;s going to lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion &quot; .
the white lines are for population .
we just have the most of the time .
and only by the way , the biggest most , the biggest of a population of population is a better education and diet in the world .
in 2010 , we had been connected to two billion people online .
until 2020 , we &apos;re going to go to a little bit of two billion internet leaders .
three billion new minds that we never heard before , the global communication is going to join .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what are they going to want ?
and instead of economic motion , i see one of the biggest economic systems of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that are going to flow in global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be treated by the use of the use of the world , and they &apos;re trained to be trained by the most remote , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to have to use 3d printers and &quot; the same thing . &quot;
so what can three billion grow growing , healthy , educated members of the most successful , productive members of the world &apos;s disease ?
as it would be with a sentence new , never before .
how do it be that the oppressed , where they &apos;re , are to give a voice to make attention and create change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people bring ?
how about the most remote thing that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i learned through the x prize is that small teams that are motivated by passion and focus , can create extraordinary things , things that could be big companies and governments in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really has been excited .
there &apos;s a program that some may know .
it &apos;s a game that is called the adaptive .
it was developed in the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will develop .
and the way that we can predict the structure is we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the world &apos;s most important .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university university , etc .
and it &apos;s hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that today the human pattern pattern is better than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked , who &apos;s the best most likely to the world , it wasn &apos;t a more , also not a more , it was a little bit of england , manchester , a woman who was working in the day as a treaty of the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what &apos;s tremendous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to ask us the big challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a computer system .
we have the capital of the world &apos;s capital .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work online to master the new challenges , and to do what is needed .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to have a little bit against a piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical school and i &apos;m .
and maybe i &apos;m a long time in business than i can give it a piece of my own wrong to this .
but before i talk to the actual topic of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re the most close to the world &apos;s world , and we &apos;re moving to the world &apos;s world .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is soon , &quot; and it &apos;s about statistics and to use this great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to be able to get a statistic of that i hope most of you have heard of it .
it &apos;s the most powerful of the most remote .
we &apos;re talking about an 300 , if a bat is 300 .
that means that the player is safe three of 10 beats .
that &apos;s what the ball is going to beat in the world , he &apos;s going to get down , and who &apos;s trying to take the ball to the first base , it doesn &apos;t have been done in time and the side of security .
three from 10 from 10 from 10 .
do you know how to call a computer in the workforce in a hurry ?
well , really good , maybe a more , a more .
you know how to call a computer model ?
this is somebody who &apos;s safe to be four .
and the way ted williams -- the last one of the last the founders of the servant of the time was a typical season of a typical season .
let &apos;s go back to the world of medicine , which i feel about a lot more comfortable or maybe a little less likely to do with you .
suppose you have a more of the time and you &apos;ll be able to get a more of the time that &apos;s a little bit of 400 in terms of the most remote .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work , right ?
suppose life in a particular remote area and they have a beloved people with a hundred people and their own favorite , and they &apos;re the most powerful to the one of the most remote , which is the most of the time in the world &apos;s .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better . it &apos;s on the line of branch .
and she &apos;s holding a more of the time .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the most of the time for a computer or a nurse or a nurse or a nurse , a more , a more , a more , a more , a more , a more , a more , a more , a more , a more .
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody in medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor should be .
but what we do is we &apos;re going to be every one of them , including me , in the world , to be perfect .
never a mistake , no one makes it think about the details , like this .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was a photo-real student student .
in high school , a peers said that brian was going to learn to be a blood company .
and so it was too .
and i learned in my little little , little in the sisters in the toronto of the toronto general hospital , and i &apos;m going to be in the caribbean .
i learned everything .
i learned the origins , and i learned the origins of every single set of the brain , every branch of a artery , which is from the aorta , and the unconscious and ordinary .
i even knew the most remote thing to disagree with the most remote of the world &apos;s .
and the whole time i collected more and more .
and i was good , i was going to get off with a lot of the time .
and i left the medical school with the impression i knew if i knew everything , and it knew anything like possible , and at least as close as possible , i can do immune to the mistakes of errors .
and it worked for a time until i met a woman .
i &apos;m going to put in a graduate student here in toronto as a woman &apos;s wife .
and i was the most of the time that i was the most remote layer of the service service .
and it was my mission , as the most the most , the most , the most , to study the most , the most remote .
and feedback to my favorite .
i studied woman printer and she was in a lot of the time .
and when i was her favorite , she made sound sound .
and when i was your chest with the most remote , i could hear a little bit of a sound on both sides that said that they suffered under the heart failure .
this is a state in the heart that failed to pump the entire blood , and it &apos;s a part of the blood rate in the lung , and it &apos;s going to be the one that &apos;s going to be the most , so the most , the most , and that &apos;s why the most important thing .
and that was not hard to be a very difficult diagnosis .
i asked her and made me on the treatment .
i gave her a divorce . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call the water of water , water , so they &apos;re the liquid .
and over a period of a time , it started to feel better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
i actually did two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my favorite .
i didn &apos;t take the end of the way , and i did what i would have had to do , what was a call in my favorite system , so he had a chance to make a chance to do a own picture .
and he knew she would have been able to get access to their own information .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the doctor &apos;s doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility that i was so , and i would be able to worry about my patients without having to join it .
my second mistake was worse .
so that &apos;s what i sent to you , i was a quiet voice in my mind , i was trying to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . &quot;
in really rare , i &apos;m very much in the way that i asked the nurse , which was the woman who was doing it , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay , if you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and he said in the way , &quot; yeah , i think it will go to her . &quot;
i remember it as a yesterday .
so i &apos;m going to get the most unhealthy and an innocence and a fractal and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest day , i had this kind of feeling in my stomach .
but i was working on .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , down the hospital and went to the parking room to drive home , when i did something that i didn &apos;t do .
i went home through the most of my way .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen the wife for woman , but a different three words to me and that three words that i know .
other medical doctors are afraid that , but the care of the care is very , very , because we &apos;re just seeing the patient .
the three words loud : remember ?
&quot; remember , do you remember the patient that you &apos;d like to go home ? &quot;
asked the nurse of popular .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said , &quot; she said in this particular way .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
about a hour after that , after i had sent her home , she was burned and the family called the caregiver . the most , they brought back to the most remote blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous thing .
they barely breathe and was blue .
the most remote thing moved all strands .
they gave her their own .
she closed them on the most remote .
i was shocked and until the inner .
and i put this rollercoaster because she came to care of the care of the care of care and i hoped that they would recover .
and after two , three days , they realized they would never be ashamed of it .
she didn &apos;t have a benign system .
their family brought up .
and in the course of the next eight or nine days , they used to be the most remote .
the day , they &apos;re going to go to the day -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say that you never forget the names of the world &apos;s name .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
and the next weeks i made myself , and i learned to the first time that the most unhealthy shame in our medical culture is -- i felt isolated , not the way that you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you all know the healthy shame when you give a secret of the best friend , even though that one on the world &apos;s , and then you get rid of the best friend , and i &apos;m going to be able to take a terrible discussion , and you can never make a mistake .
if you &apos;re doing it , and the mistakes never make it again .
this is the kind of a little bit of shame .
the unhealthy way i talk about is that the one in the heart is going to make a sick .
it &apos;s the one that says that that &apos;s not what you did , but you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t in my favorite , and it was very much .
he talked to the family and i &apos;m sure he was the leviathan industry and sure that i wouldn &apos;t be fooled .
but i asked myself to ask this questions .
why did i not ask the most of the time ? why do i send them home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why did i go in medicine ?
but slowly , it &apos;s going to put it .
i started feeling better .
and then , in a day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke and i could feel better again .
and i was out of that , if i doubled my efforts to perfection and never again a mistake , that the voice could be a little bit of the voice .
and she did .
and i kept working on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the world &apos;s hospital in a hospital hospital north of toronto and i was a 25 years old man with a $ old man .
it was a lot of go and i was in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked at the most little , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him to it .
and even as he went from the door , he showed up his favorite .
two days later , i came to my next day and my favorite , and my favorite was asked to be a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the patient &apos;s patients ? &quot;
it turns out he was a computer .
he had a potentially of a potentially , potentially , called the disease .
you can google google , but it &apos;s not infection of the most , but the upper is the top of the world &apos;s body .
and fortunately , he died .
he got a little bit of the time , and it recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same of shame and the same , felt , and i was feeling , and went to work to work and again and again .
in a computer , i have two times a more likely to miss .
there &apos;s a lot of it , especially if you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that &apos;s just 14 patients a night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and there were no governors in their treatment .
i thought he had a lot of the time .
i &apos;m going to be the x-ray of the kidney , and when it was without a more , my colleague was in the lower side of the patient , and called the immediate government .
the other had strong diarrhea .
i &apos;m going to be a lot of the time to get it to the way to get him to my colleagues and asked him to meet him .
and it did , and he was a more of the right in the right sector , he called the surgeons .
in both cases , it was been a good thing , and it was good .
both cases of me , i &apos;m going to go to me .
and i would say to you that my worst mistake was happening in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues , but total nonsense .
some of my favorite favorite years happened in the last five years .
alone , and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t close my mistakes , and you can talk about them if i &apos;m quiet , which is really not able to find what &apos;s really happening , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes that they don &apos;t make the same ?
if i was in a room -- like now , i don &apos;t know what you think about me .
when did you hear the last time of someone &apos;s last time about the most of the time about the most of the time about the world &apos;s .
oh yeah , they go to a cocktail party and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about your own mistakes .
if i was in a room full of colleagues , and to ask their immediate support and they started telling them what i &apos;ve just told you , i would not be able to get the end of the second story before it really would be uncomfortable , and you would forget the theme .
and in fact , when i knew or my colleagues , a computer of the hospital had lost someone &apos;s wrong leg , then you think i &apos;d have trouble to look at him in the eyes .
this is the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system that is two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do . those who are going to be able to take sleep and the no limitation with bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s almost a wireless response like antibodies that attack a human .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we &apos;re doing those who make mistakes from medicine , that we &apos;re a safe system .
but there are two problems that are .
in my about 20 years of medical health , journalism , i have a personal medical study about medical errors and wrong treatments to make it all possible for me to show the toronto star .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely the most profound .
we &apos;re working in a system in the every day , which is a little bit of 10 , or wrong , or wrong , in the royal , and more powerful and more , and the more unequal .
in this state , about 24,000 canadian of the time .
in the united states , the institute of medicine is the number of people who are the number of 100,000 .
both are strong , because we don &apos;t look at the problem , as we should .
and is the most powerful .
in a computer , the medical knowledge of the medical knowledge , all two to three years , can &apos;t keep the way we can &apos;t keep .
sleep is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake , so we can take a perfect thing for a patient with mobile phone .
and then i take the same patient with a little bit of patients , making it a little bit of the time and give it a slightly more easy breath to be able to be able to get the story to contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of this is the mistakes .
so if you take the system , how i was taught , and all the most of the most , the most little , is no longer left .
and you know the most little about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , white , black , black , i have the habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to every one of the most the things that i &apos;m going to say , &quot; and then i &apos;m going to show you the microphone . &quot; and then i &apos;m going to show you with the microphone . &quot; and then i &apos;ll show you with the microphone . &quot;
and then their own boards expand , they &apos;re given the head , and they &apos;re looking down and they &apos;re hard to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
you want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what you need is a environment which you &apos;re able to do in the situation .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new thing is a human doctor , a human , knows about its humanity , it &apos;s not proud of making mistakes , but it &apos;s all about learning something that can be passed .
they share their experiences with other people .
they supported when others talk about their mistakes .
and she shows other people &apos;s mistakes , not about the most , but in a loving , good way of all of that benefit .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes people fill the system with life and if that is , people also do mistakes of time .
so that &apos;s what the system is developed to create the system that makes it easier to find people who are missing people and also allowed loving spaces to create the potential , and that &apos;s what the potential is to do , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be the potential to do . and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be the potential to do .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the new doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i do mistakes .
i &apos;m going to be a lot of the time , but i &apos;m trying to learn to learn to be able to give it other people to give them .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking about , but i can live with life .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny little idea .
it &apos;s about the most remote thing .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories to use the time .
the first story is by charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know that he was in the middle of this .
they like that he &apos;s going to wake up , but it &apos;s not true .
actually , he collected fish .
he described a very &quot; usually &quot; .
it was a kind of a kind of a .
until in the &apos; 80s , he was in great style .
now he &apos;s a lot of the red list .
this story we have heard of a lot of times from the galapagos or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we still come on the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the most , they &apos;re still describing as a pipe .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story should be a different concept that &apos;s a different concept of the world &apos;s most , and they &apos;re going to be able to show .
because i &apos;ve experienced it when i was in 1971 .
i went there because i grew up in europe and wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad inversion and was convinced that i really didn &apos;t really have it .
it was my first ensemble .
as you see , the victorians of the artery and a few points of trees are .
there were about 20 inches of the , and it was a spectroscope of the most inch .
the pitch of this kind of thing were very productive and the fishermen lived well and made it good in ghana .
when i returned 27 years later , the fish was taken on half his size .
and the world &apos;s distributed measure they &apos;re going to measure five inches .
they were genetically a lot of the most primitive .
it still was fish .
people still were happy .
and the fish also had the happiness , still .
so it doesn &apos;t change anything , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story tells me about the introduction of the most of the time in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- more at the beginning of the &apos; 60s -- the &apos; 60s , many of the most many .
and the other thing was , the countries that started 100 fish , the industrial fishing of this pretty ugly ship called the fourth ship of this pretty ugly ship called the fourth ship .
i went to this , and we did the entire entire world in the entire southern sea and especially in the world &apos;s entire world .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know that it was the reason the ocean was .
90 percent of our favorite systems were translucent , other animals that are connected to the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there on the harbor lab , were the most powerful .
basically , the reason the ocean came down to a deck of the ocean and then it was down .
these images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you &apos;re going to get a survey through and starts with the most powerful fishing fishing .
the reason is , it &apos;s going to change -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft coral is going to be crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we started a living .
she wasn &apos;t drowning .
then they wanted to kill them because they could eat them good .
in fact , this mountain is going to be covered by the fishermen every time they drive in areas where they &apos;re never going to be .
it &apos;s not going to be documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we &apos;re not fit our own new level of the new level and call us not memory , which was there .
if you &apos;re going to get it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis , a few good things : biodiversity , number of the most of the world &apos;s land , the green of your country , the most remote .
and it &apos;s changing . it changes , because for people , they are very , very .
every generation of the images that you take to the beginning of your conscious life , as a standard and it will be all of it .
the difference is going to be seen as loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses right .
it can give a order of changes .
and at the end , they just want to get the main remains .
this is the most largely the goal of our goal .
we want things to get gone or things that are not so much like you were .
you could think that the problem of people were going to be , certainly , as they lived in the societies , they killed animals and they were just aware of a few generations , which they did .
because obviously , a animal that was very often there , just once , before it &apos;s a lot of the time .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of different animals .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not going to be seen as a big loss .
and we &apos;re focusing on the big animals , and the sea is the great fish .
they &apos;re going to be rare because we start .
and the time is little fish left and we think that &apos;s the most important thing .
the question is , why people accept that .
well , because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , many people are going to confirm scientists , that it was really different .
they &apos;re going to confirm it because the evidence , how they &apos;re in a former form , are not like that , as they like the evidence .
so , for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of a computer system , which watched a big field of the area that saw great , is not used , or from the most of the time , not a scientific thing , because he &apos;s not scientifically .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
that shows the enormous big role that can play a marine marine field .
because in the world area , we &apos;re basically going to put the past again .
we &apos;re asking the past to get the people who can &apos;t understand people because the most low , and very low .
so , the people who see a marine field and the view of the view , which allows you to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
what about people who don &apos;t can &apos;t be able to do that because they don &apos;t have access to the people in the middle west for example ?
here , i think , i think , the art and the film may fill the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was a lot of time -- 500 years ago .
and the most , you might remember , may be in &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people have been touched by this -- except from the most of the time , why were they touched by the most of the time ?
because it &apos;s a little bit more than a little bit of a way that &apos;s lost in a way .
so my own , the only one i &apos;m going to give you , is to be a cameron , so he &apos;s called &quot; avatar ii &quot; under water .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist , you had to , if you had a typewriter , that in the government .
they also had to be a sheet of the typewriter from this typewriter .
the reason that the government was able to be able to get rid of where a text came from .
they found a paper with a computer of the thought of the thought of the thought of the thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand the west , how anybody could do something like that , and how much that would be fed up .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
but if you &apos;re in 2011 , in 2011 , a new of the leading world &apos;s leading , and print a page , then this page has bright yellow in every page , in a pattern that &apos;s clearly clear to you and your printer .
this is what happens today .
and it seems to be no one .
and that was an example of what our own governments are doing against us , the citizens , use citizens .
and that &apos;s one of the three of the three times of the existing world today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening on the world : we can divide the attacks in categories .
we have three main types of water .
there are a lot of the time .
for example , this is mr. &apos;s favorite of the most , in the ukraine of the aspen .
and the motives of the world &apos;s very easily understanding .
these people deserve money .
they use the most much money to earn a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of the world &apos;s cases , and they &apos;re making money through attacks .
this is a little bit of the time of the computer &apos;s .
this is alfred &apos;s favorite .
stephen watts .
and the most of the time .
these are matthew anderson , and so on and so on and so on .
these people have come online to wealth , but they &apos;ve been programmed by being used by the geese , for example , to make money from our bank bank , while we &apos;re doing our online online online online , and we &apos;re also putting a lot of a computer online .
the u.s. intelligence intelligence agency is two months ago , two months ago , the swiss pepper of mr. sam , and on this x-ray , was a more sophisticated million dollars than it was frozen .
mr. neuwirth itself is on free foot , the reverse is unknown .
and i &apos;m suggesting that today , we &apos;re more likely to be victims of a computer , as a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just going to be worse .
in the future , most crimes are going to play online .
the second one that we can see today are not defined by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- cognitively , a opinion , or through your audience .
groups like anonymous are moved over the last 12 months and they &apos;re one of the most popular on the field of the world &apos;s field .
so these are the three main things : criminals , that it &apos;s about doing the money because of the money , as anonymous , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , but the last group are nations , governments that lead attacks .
there &apos;s a cases of how the most of the world &apos;s .
it shows a lot of what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
and the netherlands is a kind of a system of the netherlands -- or it was that .
in the last fall , it had to be a ride , because it was been hacked .
somebody was hacked and had the system to be hacked .
and last week in a meeting with dutch , i asked one of the senior ones that he was doing for the question , whether he was possible for possible to have the most of the people who were dying of the world .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying in a remote such way ?
and the most is a more of the time .
they sell the most of them .
what do you do with the most of the time ?
now , a certificate is , you need a certificate , if you have a website with a computer service , for example , for example .
now we &apos;re using all of us , or many of us , a new guinea or a account of their competitors , but these services are particularly prevalent in the u.s.
but you can do it , if you &apos;re in an industrial foreign foreign .
and the most fake thing , and fake the fake .
and that &apos;s what happens in the case of the world &apos;s point .
how do it work with the arab spring and things that are happening in egypt ?
well , in egypt , the grim singularity in april 2011 , the headquarters of egyptian , and they found a lot of records .
in these records , a folder was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in this folder , notes were a local company , which was a number of programs that had a few programs that they had -- in very big frame -- any communication of egyptian citizens could be able to hold .
they had sold this program for a standstill for the egyptian government .
the most is here .
so western governments are helping governments to be governments with the most of the citizens that can be able to make their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , only a few weeks ago , the so-called the so-called the so-called the so-called the world &apos;s . that was a polar bear , which was used by german .
if you &apos;re going to be in a more of the world &apos;s being in a more common , it will be very safety to make your phone .
but today we are far beyond the .
they tap their behavior .
they use resources like the most , to make their computers with a polar bear , which allows you to monitor their entire communication , their own communication cylinder , their parallels to collect their own .
so if we &apos;re going to think about these things , the obvious answer is , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a great citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i don &apos;t hide . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not at debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we today , in 2011 , our governments like trust is every right , which we &apos;re going to make for all of us .
and we trust , we trust blind one future of any future government , a government that we may have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to deal with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the computer .
the first one of the first things were made , and the first one of the simple idea : raleigh from tadpoles , which fit .
and the most quickly , very quickly , became the most quick the world &apos;s most quickly .
they put us in the situation , to build things bigger than we , building buildings , bridges , a stone after another .
basically , the most , the building system was become the building building of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out with this .
it was called &quot; automatically &quot; .
and within a few years , lego moved into every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego did it for all possible .
lego has basically been the most important , building building in the world , and it made a building building for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the same year , the same year was announced the next revolution , the next building building .
the transistor was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of us that was a static building of the static building building in the world .
as the most powerful , we allow us to build a lot more complex , more complex , more complex .
but there &apos;s a kind of a little bit of a sudden : the transistor was only for experts .
i personally accept that that the building building of our time is for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started studying this idea , how to do the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started to develop a lot of years ago .
let me show you how they work .
and the electronic sands are electronic frames that have a specific function .
they &apos;re a lot of light , light , sound , motor and sensor .
and the best thing about it is that they connect to magnets .
so you can &apos;t put them wrong around them .
the stones are the more than the stones .
green is copy , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is wires .
so everything you need to do is to connect a blue and a green with each other and build it very quickly .
they add a blue blue , and they can make light .
you can switch a switch between it and they have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
take the switch out to get a more of the time that &apos;s here , and you &apos;ve made a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
add this kind of thing to a extra effect , and they &apos;ve made a more of the time .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and the simple play is actually quite powerful .
instead , you have to code , and you have to be able to program , and you have to do it with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to accelerate the most controlled or slow , you just turn on this button and it makes the momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind the world &apos;s idea is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world in a more of the world .
lights , sound , the motors , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve been able to spread in children and look at it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how they start to understand electronics that they &apos;re in the everyday world and they don &apos;t learn in school .
like , for example , a kind of a work , or why the doors of the world &apos;s doors are , or how a ipod respond to touch .
we also brought up to the most remote .
so , we had for example to example of designers with no experience in electronic things that started playing with a material .
here we see , with a lot of paper , paper and water water , like the ...
a few weeks ago , we &apos;ve got to risd and gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; do what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of one project that they made , a more of the time .
but wait , this is really my favorite .
it &apos;s a very a handful of play-doh , which is fear in the darkness .
for these of you , the most different material was a different material , electronics was just another material .
and we want to make this material available for all of us .
so , the open source is open source .
you can go to the website , all the most , and they make them make themselves .
we want to make the world the creator , the inventor , the exclusive , because that world , in which we live , is that interactive world , we heard .
so , pull up and start to invent them .
thank you .
