darwin was the opinion that atheism has already been right and good for the gangs , but the most good people , but probably , say , &quot; not a way for that . &quot;
if people like -- when atheists like stephen hawking and albert einstein uses the word &quot; god , &quot; they use it as a practical metaphor for this deep , fuzzy part of physics that we don &apos;t understand .
and the launch cost about 500 dollars , about 10,000 dollars today .
and used to have a person who had a license , you had a license , and it had to be a license , and it had to be if this was a license or property .
because there &apos;s a certain sense of a sense or a little bit of involved when there are several involved in wikipedia , ) , ) a particular sentence of social relationships .
i have no slides , so you &apos;ll have to be able to get to me .
a study of the world &apos;s research has shown that there &apos;s a clear kind of a very clear thing in 28 african countries .
the state should not be in the production of the production , and services , because he &apos;s inefficient and elegance on this area .
but what it &apos;s like immediately , the fact was the concept of our economic development -- that , when oil oil was high , our economy grew up very quickly .
the same thing we do in the world &apos;s .
and i would have been thinking that you &apos;re looking at this .
he called them , &quot; massive fatal of &quot; what means that you could kill to 100 million people in the next 50 years .
until recently , we didn &apos;t know how a vaccine was just made .
the main challenge for these two viruses is that they &apos;re constantly changing .
these drugs are not a cure , but they &apos;re a huge triumph of science , because they &apos;re the automatic death of a computer at least for those who have access to them .
but you know , the research that has happened to hiv has helped us very much with the progress of other diseases .
that was a slow , a process , which was dependent on chicken chicken , millions of living chicken chicken chicken .
and the radically increase production production and the vast of the e. is a way to be able to be a way that i &apos;ve been talking about -- look at the legal time -- that would be the most important life .
so the challenge is full of the force .
the question is , why ?
do you think the african union will organize such a conference ?
there are some things that you need to know .
the speaker who was here on the stage was , in the stage , mohamed , refused to be able to have the leaders in africa .
by controlling it from your suffering .
traditionally , africans hate africans -- they hate the transactions .
they decide what they do .
he doesn &apos;t get help from the government , and he &apos;s building a second , bigger boat .
something that would connect us all together .
scott &apos; results were full of it .
and the challenge for anemia , these personalized filters , is that they &apos;re going to climb these balance , because they &apos;re going to click in front of the first day .
it &apos;s supposed to be us to new ideas and the new people and strangers .
and the man said , &quot; very beautiful ted game , what ? &quot;
i know you &apos;re waiting for more bad , and i just do fun -- but now , just a short repetition , and then i &apos;ll show you new materials about possible solutions .
until the most , it &apos;s going to be a update on the may 2.0 , where you can go directly to buy the purchase of the world .
even again , the republicans here , it should not be about the most of the republicans .
what i really impressed in the gulf is that they &apos;re a lot of the time .
and there &apos;s actually no longer trying to do that , except a few people trying to use the beach .
we &apos;ve heard that bacteria eat oil ?
this is the whole sea swimming around the ocean .
when the japanese pearl harbor harbor , they were at least back .
what the microbes are doing is i don &apos;t want to make a slave remarks about people who clean birds .
okay , people who are calling themselves as conservative , if they really wanted to be conservative and they wanted to be very conservative , then they should send these business companies to the most remote .
it &apos;s right , and wrong .
and i &apos;ve developed a system to produce medical gs .
okay , &quot; i &apos;m more than my genes -- all together .
i didn &apos;t ask you to get it to the way because it &apos;s true , but to remember you .
they contain a molecule which we know as a brain .
and that &apos;s just a kind of a more small . it &apos;s a lot smaller than a human being .
well , neurons , as well as trees , can grow new branches and lose old .
and we can even talk about the most of the time .
if you pick this number , you can easily make a difference that there &apos;s a big potential for the brain in the brain .
maybe this technology will be able to meet ourselves through the way we &apos;re going to meet ourselves through the way we &apos;re going to get away .
he &apos;s working mostly at video videos and ads with his company , the most remote .
so we &apos;ve prepared a quick experiment to show you that .
ks : no , not yet .
while he did that , he noticed a unexpected thing .
ks : so , how does it work : there &apos;s a matrix of the world &apos;s .
ridiculous , right ?
and a few months ago , i sent a a dream to this guy , eduardo sousa .
a huge gas for a few weeks .
but he still did .
so his farm is incredible .
and then he found this wild plant , which is the most common .
and then they fly in the circle , and then they fly in the circle .
i finally came to try and try and try and try and try and try .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no analog .
what hell is that is that ?
at least . i think it &apos;s .
farmers , who rely on nature to find solutions , to find answers instead of nature , instead of nature .
and from the old fire to the new fire , two big stories about oil and electricity , which are both two fifth of fossil europe in the air .
our fuel for mobility is three fifth of cars .
you can let it be quiet , it &apos;s tougher than titan .
trucks and planes can use realistic hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
also better light and the size of the world &apos;s size and so forth , the lowest world &apos;s atmosphere to be a third .
in about 20 , private oil systems are hidden in the cheap solar system without financial losses on their roofs and lower their own .
and what we also replace it is , it will cost about the same cost : about six trillion dollars in the net -- although we buy more of what we have or new power , or renewable , which is more or less .
so , on results , and not incentives , to focus , can be able to focus on the way , and conflict of the energy of america &apos;s solution .
later , i realized that what i had eaten , two of the things i had was all the family .
so this simple thing shows that donors in areas , where the least kids go to school , not funded schools , and this brings new questions to be .
two years ago , at the eight years , 2010 , i called my father .
i &apos;m not trying to design the toothbrush .
we remember , and can you look at this in every book of my favorite son , that life was born four billion years ago -- four billion point ?
so , i &apos;m not quite sure .
there are risks , there are a case .
you have time to think of it , you have time to talk about art , and things like that .
you go back to the future , back , back , back , so .
they all come from families where mostly one person is at home , mostly the mother or grandmother , and they come up with their education and their structure here .
we bring them to the right and on the left , so they can follow and know the consequences if they &apos;re going to be fooled .
let &apos;s all go online . &quot;
it &apos;s predicting .
they said , &quot; that &apos;s enough for the most of the time .
you can support us . that &apos;s the task of you guys . &quot;
but i have to have my monopoly .
you can listen and invite .
so , for example , let &apos;s take the most of the most important things .
if you think about the concept of wikipedia , everybody on the content , and you have the largest encyclopedia of the world .
there are many people who have the same dream .
a website was created .
there was no leader .
extremism has become tolerance .
the modern tools of neuroscience show us that what happens there is an incredibly complex process .
we can hold sounds of our own language , but not the strangers .
we &apos;re looking at the american babies who never heard a second language at the beginning of the critical phase of the key phase .
it may look like a computer of mars , like a computer of mars .
science on one side has a very rational approach to their environment , while art is usually a emotional approach to his environment .
now i have a finite one over here to show you that .
let me show you this over here .
the dalai lama once said , &quot; love and compassion are the most powerful .
the main the brain &apos;s brain was burned by a little girl whose body was burned .
it &apos;s part of every human being .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we choose compassion ?
the wound of the maggots .
suppose you like squares , and honestly , who don &apos;t you like ?
we start with a computer and then we &apos;re going to ask another more of the more .
then there was a more of the time that there was a more of the time .
i &apos;m like , &quot; he &apos;s already dead .
&quot; did i have what &apos;s going on ! &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t get a bullet . what happens ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what do you do here ? &quot;
so i went into the lobby and saw this indian guy .
marco tempest : when you asked him to deception , he said , &quot; magic is the only thing . &quot;
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to demonstrate you how closely terrorism is connected to our daily lives .
and at the time , when i interviewed the red brigades , i discovered that their lives didn &apos;t be from ideology and politics , but from economic constraints .
i think many people even thought of me for a little bit of a little bit .
but mostly they went into serious health systems with the organized crime .
this money was in the u.s. and the most remote , and in bar , understanding .
nobody wants to control the most powerful , and his favorite , with customers , are feeding with clients .
some of you may think , &quot; wait . you don &apos;t necessarily see how a computer of a sudden .
yeah , i wanted to leave my favorite , but what i was not looking at was that it was amazing , that it &apos;s amazing to leave his own .
and i really learned that , the bigger the challenge , the bigger , the bigger , the feeling of a special performance when you get to the end .
well , i thought the atlantic was big , but the pacific is really big .
but that wasn &apos;t the way that it wasn &apos;t .
it &apos;s this little green disk on the horizon , which you &apos;re very nervous about rising sea level .
we can start to meet better , more , more sustainable decisions .
and the other thing i &apos;m talking about is why i &apos;m about the pacific .
this is the world trade trade on the front page .
why ? why ? why do you want to do that ?
he doesn &apos;t see a surplus cost . he doesn &apos;t use additional time .
they were able to make that .
and the last time it goes to comfort , it &apos;s about the fact that they feel good at places that they didn &apos;t feel good .
and that &apos;s hard if you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i asked myself , how can it be so easy to give my dreams ?
it &apos;s not so hard to do someone , and one day , i said , &quot; well , you can get my homework , &quot; and i gave him the wrong answers to the day i had in the night before .
we both have been put on the back of the class in the class , so we wouldn &apos;t be engaged with the most remote .
maybe you brought your own and brought your teeth , but never told you , because how can you say yourself , if all around you , you &apos;d like to put you under you ?
this is french science .
well , then .
if you look at this truck here ; it &apos;s the largest truck of his kind of the way on earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the biggest and the fastest growing growing of co2 in canada , and it &apos;s also the reason why canada is now the number three in terms of a head .
and as a father , i can &apos;t imagine what the soul is doing .
by doing that , we take a big part of our biggest largest , and replace it with most greenhouse gases of the future .
the most of the time of their work is the most , that you can buy in every store and the millions of indian women every day on their forehead . it &apos;s about a ritual that &apos;s deeply connected with the institution of marriage .
and the shaw shaw was born in the southern world , in the heart of the city , in the heart of the city .
i hope you can convince it that complex and complicated not always are the same .
the most , the most , is the one that we want to affect -- public support for government .
so i proposed in my first tedtalk that we should spend as planet 21 billion hours a week with video games .
only 30 minutes a day of a day , a young improvement of the mood and the most important increase of joy .
why a game ?
how could a game play so much of a huge effect in this serious , sometimes , sometimes , in the way , situations ?
there are four species of strength , or resilience to make growth growth , and there are scientific tags , which you can do every day to build these resilience , you don &apos;t need a trauma .
and more practice is going to be fed .
here &apos;s a secret for you : if you shake somebody &apos;s hand for six seconds , the most expensive thing is going to be increasing in your blood , which is &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in this project , we actually have hundreds of people around the world , and they &apos;re doing that with us . actually , thousands of people are involved in this project , in many of his different aspects .
and then a few people came from chicago and said , &quot; end 2007 is the slogan of chicago , the global warming festival , we have a little square gallery and we want them to fill them with their reef . &quot;
wool and the most , not just two concepts that fit good .
and so , &quot; how can i define parallel lines ? &quot;
infinitely . they were in the same way .
so we have , from wool , put away , the evidence of the , the proof of the mathematics that is wrong in mathematics .
and their individual ideas , and their engagement with this mathematical method .
this particular thing -- the purpose of the purpose -- is my opinion of the holy grail of neuroscience , the neuroscience , and eventually we &apos;ll understand what &apos;s going on .
this person is otherwise in a decent mind and intelligent , but if he sees his mother , his delusion , he &apos;s not going to say it &apos;s his mother .
so if that area is damaged , you lose the ability to see faces .
tables and chairs and chairs -- nothing happens , as a normal thing , as i &apos;m going to show him , but if i show him a picture of his mother , the most remote activity is low .
he knows that his arm is not there . nonetheless , it &apos;s a persuasive , a convincing experience .
maybe you can do that the most little , the characteristic of the phantom .
and my pain are gone . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , the last three days i didn &apos;t have phantom and therefore no longer a phantom , no more , no more , no more , no more pain in the auditorium . all my pain are gone .
and the blue is blue , a little bit of green , another sound could be yellow .
this is the key .
what is kiki , which is a screenshot ?
you &apos;re going to be a lot of the time that most of us don &apos;t care about it .
this is kanzi .
none of the things you &apos;re going to see in this video are a lot of the time .
good .
he learned that he was both using hands , with his various of his devices , much larger and more , much larger and more .
a frame means a hut in the forest .
does he look where the sound comes ?
because we believe that it &apos;s not the biology , but the culture .
and some stars die in spectacular explosions that are leaving these remains .
on the right , gravity is the gravity . einstein explains this .
and it &apos;s going to get it out of the change .
it was still too early , but he was a moral building , a inspiration for scientists who were worried about control of the weapons .
let &apos;s take alien creatures to see our favorite dot from far outside the cosmos , and not only for 40 years , but the whole half billion years of the world &apos;s earth &apos;s earth .
martin ornish : is this our last century ?
and it &apos;s still worse : &quot; then i would make a photograph of it and make a dozen year-old .
well , these are students , so they gave a lot of money to things like the tar and neptune .
and then we asked them to do how happy they are .
but enormous different incentives .
these are the most remote in belgium .
the teams that we gave money to spend it together , they were in other teams , and they actually were the backbone of the auditorium .
if we hear about the most of the most high , the high school , we often believe that this is another one of these of the most powerful conflicts of the middle east , the roots of itself .
ironically , this was a time when the most of the iran was the peace of iran , and not the destruction of israel .
this is an analogy that &apos;s going to be able to make the diplomacy in the way that diplomacy is inevitable .
you can look at certain of the things , or you can look at the different regions and compare them .
the map of port is not the end of 2009 , not as well as they could have been , not as good as the map of california .
the trick is : the trick .
and the explanation she said , &quot; he was not an mp3 . &quot;
this system wants to keep the status quo , also the status quo of a car government .
so it &apos;s not that my topic is the most important thing . it &apos;s not .
we can &apos;t do anything . &quot;
lawrence lessig : we , the citizens , have to go back the republic
for example , some people are going to be in this room , and they went to school with a scholarship .
this is on my pen . &quot;
everybody is just a little bit of a little bit .
i don &apos;t want to say that the law of entropy is not true , it &apos;s true .
here &apos;s the model of the attack of the world &apos;s attack .
if you see fireflies in north america , the way that many things are in the united states are independent . they ignore each other .
each of your favorite region depends on this critical region , the most important , which has about 10,000 independent cells , which has any structural rhythm , a electronic rhythm -- a high tension , a low , low -- to send a signal to pump a signal .
they were a while in the world &apos;s day , but then they were apart .
so i want to show you a few interviews with people who were opening up on the bridge and describe what happened .
now , you don &apos;t usually hold it for a statistician , but we &apos;re all running -- we &apos;re going to go back and back to walk .
im : this is just a few tons , so it &apos;s right .
but the most of the scientists in his area .
i didn &apos;t say what the list was , but she was in the order of order , and i told you , they should look at their names , their own name , or the date of their mother .
and also , maybe this guy &apos;s got a computer or maybe a more of the time that &apos;s not worth economic , a resilience against disease or a different property that is useful for climate change , and the other thing is not .
we &apos;re going to see kids in television .
the idea with reconciliation was that there &apos;s cold , so you have natural temperatures under the freezing .
and if anything happens , you can come and pick it up .
thank you .
look at your body . this is not right .
maybe any lady , a lady ? thank you very much .
you just tried two concepts -- two in the united states , and one at the russians .
madness ! i have to talk briefly about innovation -- the things are developing , there &apos;s a lot of activity , and then they &apos;re replaced by something else and die .
i can &apos;t tell you when it goes , because i don &apos;t want the competition to know my jaw .
i mean something really interesting that &apos;s going to happen here .
ok , let &apos;s talk a little bit about the commercial development of the human space space .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a few years , he &apos;s ready to give you a epiphany , but he &apos;s got a epiphany .
institutions are going to be naked , and if you &apos;re naked , well , it has the consequences .
the fourth meaning of openness and the fourth principle is , is a lot of it .
the villagers is from the most remote .
you know that bees and fish live in schools .
all around us , a medical revolution , instead of having a revolution , is going to help us defeat some of the worst diseases of our society , cancer with including cancer .
this is a tumor , dark , gray , a heroic mass , a tutor in a brain .
and you can see that the ring of the blood supply goes down .
but the real question is : how good do these in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add a computer . it prevents angiogenesis to very effective way .
but more interesting is coming from the study that the men who have developed the most , so the ones that have more tomato sauce , had less blood vessels , which had less blood vessels that feed their cancer .
albert von the most of the time said , &quot; discoveries is to see what all of you have seen , and think about what nobody has thought . &quot;
i &apos;m a very , very magazine magazine .
it has to make fun , unlike everyday problems that are honest not quite well .
this is the background of the other .
you can &apos;t do that physically , but on a computer , it &apos;s going to be over to the computer .
i wanted to make a sequel .
what direction will you be going to fall here ?
so there &apos;s games like &quot; brain republican &quot; for the champagne of the champagne , a more , a more , a more .
looks like a black character . where is this ?
i really believe that a girl is to be so powerful that we had to train all of that , not to be like that .
i remember , as my father , who was very , very violent , i proposed .
we &apos;re so used to justify girls of the impact , to be the most of your own life that we actually made them in the way to objects and they were turned into it .
and she looked at her babies and she said , &quot; of course , i love my baby . how could i not love my baby ?
when we were there , she did a ritual where they were girls who are the artery , with their families .
and i &apos;m going to be for the rest of your life . &quot;
i love that i don &apos;t take things easy .
why should you get me off , you want to go out ?
so , in the real process , all six teenagers said , and the most of the time they were doing the most , they had made the photo .
but the incident was taken in january in january , on the northern hemisphere , to seven o &apos;clock at night .
this is 10 feet away .
and what &apos;s this example -- what about it is to keep us in memory ?
he was a very religious man .
i got a year and traveled a year through africa , where i asked people why they built fractals , which is a great job when you can get it .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in some villages to the smallest level .
it &apos;s not really mathematical knowledge .
he said , &quot; if i lived in the jungle , i would just use a long time to use it , because it &apos;s very fast and it &apos;s very cheap .
and so , really , odd makes odd .
we have a more of the most remote .
but the bad news is : it &apos;s :
instead of turning friends or relatives , they looked at david &apos;s workplace .
today , agile development is applied to a hundred countries and enough to be up to the most remote .
fear of the world &apos;s fear .
we &apos;re going to think of some rules and keep them stuck .
the conversation will run better . &quot;
and i just like to get a day to come here to come up with one of my daughters , and i started to get a daughters .
and we developed 10 statements .
i was a teenager when i first read &quot; anna &quot; and the famous first sentence , &quot; all happy families , same families , same family .
i want to show you how something that can be so beautiful .
if i put this in the water , you see a silver , and this is the most remote one , the water that fits the water from the world &apos;s water . it stays dry .
and plato with all the young boys in his cave . sweeney : &quot; -- &quot; ...
i &apos;m going to show you .
but tesla was not about duration .
one thing i want to do is that not all the projections are wearing .
we can get them out or turn it down , or turn out .
he &apos;s one of five children .
i showed you that we can apply it into the circuits of the mood of depression .
we &apos;re to understand what these circuits are and what the brain is responsible for the clinical signs and symptoms of these diseases .
evolution works in reality as a guy as a engineer .
this is enough !
what we &apos;ve discovered is if you look at the leg of a human being , or a cockroach or a container or a certificate , the relative world , the relative of this feather is the same for all that we &apos;ve seen .
okay . the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , right ? it &apos;s incredible , students have tried it and they couldn &apos;t tell them .
he does this with a more of the glue .
what we do is , we take the hair as a model , and imagine with a different colleague of berkeley .
and showed that from the back of the landing leader , two thirds of the time men have children , but only one third of the time of the children .
at monday , i left san francisco , my favorite , and flew to this conference .
and we go out on the end , look at us and say , &quot; how did it go ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous study of harvard business school about a woman named heidi .
and i &apos;ve got my hand back and i fell in all the other women and then you &apos;ve got more questions , just by men . &quot;
a woman announced me about this and i looked at it -- she looked at something young .
thank you .
they don &apos;t do it so many as they should , but they do it .
so not fear was the emperor of the nation-state .
but it &apos;s true in the middle .
i want to talk about this , thinking about how we spread in this country , how we get information .
so they &apos;re in clean , more , more , more , and that works .
we tell them that everything is okay ; it &apos;s good .
this patient is about 50 , we can say pretty precisely how big his risk is to get prostate cancer .
they don &apos;t need the level of the audience in this room .
and this bee certainly had imagined , &quot; i &apos;m going to get this kind of thing to me , these flower , i &apos;ll take the nectar and then go down . &quot;
and if you talk about nature , the author is my favorite theme , how is the idea of the idea ?
well , we &apos;re all equally sophisticated .
the only technology here is the cheap of the cheap , pretty new , a car car , even i could close to a finite of 10 minutes .
if a computer &apos;s a computer , the grass is going to be on this towel , and it &apos;s happening immediately .
and now i say i want to build a layer of games on the world , but that &apos;s not quite true , because it &apos;s already in development .
if not , it &apos;s the most bad thing . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
come to a certain time , you get your drinks for half .
and then you can really get good things .
and it &apos;s powerful .
and the world &apos;s population is a social dynamic that tries to find the best news , which is the most exciting stories .
we talked to you a few years ago .
you also see , if i turn around this -- hopefully i don &apos;t get the world too much .
you can see here , there &apos;s started .
this is one of our engineers .
ethics , which is actually supposed to be taught students to teach the law of the cause of the cause , just as a hobby , like a benign , sort of a hobby .
raise your hands .
it makes it a place where it makes fun to work .
and that &apos;s why we &apos;re working on what we &apos;re working on , and we even have people who are excited about it and crazy enough that they &apos;re working on it .
thank you .
what brunel , like he said , wanted to reach for his passengers , the experience of the landscape .
what does life do easier , comfortable ?
part of the most , they &apos;re using this by building a great new facility , using basement of one of their hospitals .
today , the industrial systems of time have been a lot of time , and they were actually part of the present problem .
and as brunel can , we can , by using systems , a bigger effect .
from my masculinity , the waiter was surprised with his boss .
mark : and i &apos;ve tried to get in a series of studies , right ?
yet , it &apos;s exactly what the american paradigm requires .
but for the northern hemisphere , the life was the kidney availability of all these things on the market like a more of the time .
the americans themselves discover that 8,000 choices seem more attractive than in practice .
and the parents would say , &quot; noah was just like , &quot; noah was just for this short time , but he taught us so much .
robert earle once said this , &quot; it &apos;s poetry that &apos;s lost in translation . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant kind of pink . &quot;
the three problems have one together : they &apos;re a lot of problems that are controlled by forces .
so , thank you .
it &apos;s supposed to replace competition through collaboration .
and then we build a more of the world we can test the lowest performance of machines , and so we can be very , very quickly .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that the most best thing is not as a kind of a child &apos;s best thing , but as a result of movement .
the nuclear weapon enters the stage .
and then the 92 nuclear nuclear power would provide the energy of the energy , the rest of los angeles .
then you take it and stick it on the screen of television , and you &apos;re looking at the inside of the inside of it , right ?
if you replace the word of the &quot; queerer or today , it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very supportive . listen to it . &quot;
i think it was this exchange that led to computers .
ph : i hope you understand how to do that .
finally , the race is won to be won to the future as the phone phone .
mm : because it gave the audience a role to do something .
they produce things for 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute .
and where television has what &apos;s built , which is a very exciting new way of communication , and we have the collaboration of two industries and a new way of thinking about it .
this is a spanish architect and designers .
color can be simple blocks , simple materials : if i go through new york , i think .
and it gave me suggestions -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco and we all talk to us and build some installations .
the use of the city for the public space is a significant model , almost a international model .
even the parts of the airplane had french hearing .
he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s more girls there . &quot;
and that was finally what i was , after some of the most , and the design of design , which ended up with the design of the chair i &apos;m going to show you .
he said they have one of the new ones .
or they &apos;re moving up to the position .
but i knew , i knew , and when i put myself into the offices , where there was a lot of the office , where there was no idea that anybody would come to the idea , and to turn the back to the head of the head , and turning the head to the head .
and the diver has spread in the way .
two days ago , i can &apos;t remember that , i &apos;ve read in a computer , i read that the first one , is the first one , about 52 , about 52 , and about 400 likely to have about 400 likely .
we need something that was really a really powerful thing that he &apos;s not the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : males hits females , every amount of offspring .
so , the biggest problem is not our biggest problem .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; why here ? &quot;
and most of the time i remove it , i &apos;m barely going to be a more , more than i &apos;m a computer .
look at the data .
now , our mobile phones can now engineer a story of our favorite model .
bill &apos;s : their health depends on where they live .
this is my grandfather .
and the simple reason that nobody else talks about it .
as the beginning , the other thing explains phosphorus phosphorus through water from the ground .
here &apos;s a title of a remarkable article from a &quot; nature &quot; that &apos;s the discussion of the crisis .
eighty percent of it is going to be lost like this .
and instead of taking a dose of 100 percent of a hundred percent .
we have a working technology and one that &apos;s going to use some of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the people that we &apos;re going to do on the world .
and he was a called a call : he looked all the most little and mutations to find rules and laws , instead of looking at the norms .
and in this example , you see that the individual stages are repeat , but they &apos;re going to repeat without being a more of the time .
as an architect , i think just about relationships between the pieces and all the things , but in terms of design models , it &apos;s always a matter of business .
we were sitting on the level of the building , where we could build five separate towers , but they should all be on the 60 floor to a single mass of the mass .
come back again , a few years later , 2003 , and we &apos;ll see that these landscape are honest to the same time after rainforest .
the difference is especially in the desert in the desert , or maybe the most , in the desert , whatever they want .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that were illegal , and now , in the air .
we &apos;ve doubled the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world just just by fertilizers , which causes huge problems in the water water ; in rivers , lakes and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the most important thing for the most important thing .
but we can do that and there are opportunities to do it .
irrigation is the biggest largest largest largest system on the world &apos;s .
have to work .
so -- what is the operating system that &apos;s actually the operating system ?
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
the whole system system pays no taxes .
we interact with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biological housing to amplify these kinds of things -- muscles .
so this is what it looks like .
so here we are , or cut the nerve free , from small parts of the world , and they were leaving other people &apos;s own -- signal , two other ones that we have our hand -- the signal gave us the signal .
ak : it works good .
but i can &apos;t put a electrode in the way , and i say , &quot; there . &quot;
and that &apos;s our goal -- something clinically to have to carry .
this is jesse and he press a more of the time .
so thank you .
sub-saharan africa is largely , there &apos;s 22 million people in the world there , which are more powerful 70 percent of the 30 million people in the world .
governments have to create effective , effective , for ethical aspects of evolutionary trials in clinical trials , which are being approved in the different developing world .
the fundamental problems that we &apos;re faced with is to be a high consumption and too many people .
so they all meet criteria that are usually like people .
so you see this electricity , which goes north -- the most , in this case -- the to the galapagos , and that &apos;s the way that the top , the most , the world &apos;s galapagos , which is going to go up to the galapagos .
we also know that not only are threatened by the only time , but it &apos;s just the same penguins and other people .
so i want to show you that penguins are moved into the world .
turbo has been able to pat with his eyesight to the door . we let him go in and he comes in here .
and then there &apos;s another one that comes out of very comfortable .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we don &apos;t have solved : our basic political geography .
the two parts of a very long frontier .
again , as the case of mongolia , china didn &apos;t be held russia . it &apos;s a lot of it .
for the world , countries reduce its own , so that the most remote and cambodia were sold to their own , and they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be dependent on china .
what i want to introduce you to here is i call a day , day day .
these two arrows form a bow , a bow of the world &apos;s head and other infrastructure that connects the west bank with the gaza .
a lot of them .
so what &apos;s next ? how does the future of european union come from ?
53 countries and in far the most likely of the suspects are right lines on the map .
this dream is his own time .
it &apos;s bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
okay .
and the hormone imbalance is allowing growth .
so how can a hormone eventually be fed the speed of aging ?
we think insulin and the microscopic hormones are hormones that are active in particular , in good times -- if food is to be there , and not much stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details about how it works , but we know that foxo genes have a impact on life expectancy of people .
basically , you could change the genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process i &apos;ve talked about , which is a very fast thing to be in the worm , has a different normal , a lot of the bird , so that the bird can live much longer .
they &apos;re never going to see a display , because nike wants to buy their shoes .
they all show heroes that were the most powerful .
it &apos;s like trying to walk against a more of the time .
this view is that many of the most sophisticated things like prozac is essentially changing the chemistry of the brain as if in fact , the brain of the container would be a chemical soup .
and my favorite colleague of seymour &apos;s colleague believes that .
and we found out that a mutant , a lot longer , needed to get a lot of longer to get back to the most , and when we were the genes that were playing in this mutation , we could discover a more of the way .
and this question has been asked for a long time to be in humans , but we can actually test it .
so , the mosquitoes are finding us in the dark by putting us out of the dark . they smell .
just with it , it &apos;s the cheese .
people even said to me that they &apos;re going to be fooled by mosquitos .
in the world .
and every time i felt the mexican look at the eyes of the eyes behind me .
and as a result , fat is one of the best sources of adults .
as we talk , about a stranger , the research of the use of stem cells for the use of stem cells .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angels in the world . not only in our country : venezuela . in our entire world .
so what happens when what happens ?
but here you see what really is going on .
i can &apos;t tell you about it , because i stopped the headline .
and the characteristic of the question is , what you don &apos;t know about before marriage .
but how ?
it &apos;s even better . it seems to be that we can make this receiver , with help that in dna is turning in the dna .
the animal jumps , it &apos;s expanding its wings , it &apos;s breaking up , but it can &apos;t really take you , because the fly between two glass is caught .
for a smart creature like our fly , this rule is not in stone , but it changes , while the animal learns through experience .
and so , through many such experiments , we were able to handle identity of the critic to 12 cells .
there &apos;s a few ideas in the world &apos;s most powerful and the artificial intelligence , as you could do , but we still haven &apos;t solved a single example of how intelligent behavior of the physical interaction is in the physical interaction .
here &apos;s an icelandic , or actually a kind of a kind of aravind .
ed : is clear . tb : okay . a little bit of inside , a little bit more to the middle .
and i know that hospitals can be a very dangerous place for young people .
here &apos;s a picture of my favorite of the legacy of legacy .
and i &apos;m saying , one of the things that i &apos;m going to do is to do this kind of connection , which is all of the way to their goals , the most , the most remote transformation we &apos;re going to see in health care .
they &apos;re not stick like a coordination nor a coordination or glue .
here we have the robot .
marc : the most of the time the most remote thing built .
what would happen when you go down to the bottom of the paper paper and it came to a computer or we would shake the sheet ? &quot;
and so , i &apos;m going to go . and he &apos;s doing this .
of course , as you see that in a computer .
we &apos;re going to look at the rising sea level .
and i would say that people work in the ocean and think about the goals , we should be a lot lower .
this is the ship i was the last three months in antarctica .
if this ice rises up the sea level to six feet .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news for the coral islands are .
you have the water water .
but then you see the end of the world &apos;s end in black .
we have very interesting opportunities to have co2 emissions in the atmosphere of millions of years , but in this case , we &apos;re going to go back 20 million years .
and this is the task that einstein has asked : figure out how the gravity works .
einstein already had space and time , biases and curves to describe gravity .
but deep in the structure of space hidden , so the idea , it could give more dimensions than we see there .
and as the strings of a cello , the strings can be different in different patterns , and they can be fooled in different patterns .
not yet .
is this just a interesting mathematical construction that may be able to explain some of the things that are going to explain , or can we actually demonstrate these extra dimensions ?
so we have two plates here with colorful dots .
now , can the predator see the predator , which is it , you attack ?
and what &apos;s true about sensory information is generally true for all information .
and we look at about 30 seconds , which is quite a hammer in a 18 minutes .
why ? because if the left in this shadow actually was in the shadow and the same amount of light on your eye , like the daf-2 , you would have to reflect more -- just after laws of physics .
how do you know that ?
and she comes into the beehive , find a empty , empty , and it &apos;s honey .
he finds him . madness , right ?
do you agree ? yes ?
often there &apos;s no right or wrong here .
in 2010 , in new york , not so much .
we &apos;re also a species of storyteller .
now some things : understanding security , the risks , the dangers , the uprising , like they work .
but in a modern and complex world , they need models to understand the many risks we &apos;re faced with .
think about cancer , avian flu , flu , sars .
there was no new insights , but less fear .
and there &apos;s another cognitive bias : i call it a little bit of the way that we tend to accept data that we &apos;re connecting to , and data is allowing our own data to be able to disagree with .
i know a different group , whether my airplane was safe to fly with it .
this is the people .
and he was found in the near , stanford .
they had good fine with their teachers , students .
let me ask you some questions to figure out whether that &apos;s a good choice . &quot;
i took it to anyone who &apos;s going to put it on a , and to save it , and to save me as a volunteer , but i found that nobody did something .
we opened the first section in 2009 .
robert : a park in the sky building
and groups were very often called &quot; terrorists &quot; .
they need a process of a process that &apos;s the core of this very complicated society with its problems .
it &apos;s about that we probably have a revolution in the arab world , a revolution .
paradox is that the last decade was so promising . and that &apos;s from a reason .
and once they were calling their tadpole , they didn &apos;t just call their tadpole on the streets -- they took them in the negotiations , because they &apos;re the victims of these weapons .
thank you for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so this was completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little crazy to work on a new new school .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this strange rich man in the movie ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the last day comes out the sun , the nintendo , they come straight to the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i &apos;m going to give you a little nervous here because i &apos;m going to tell you a few radical things about how we should think about cancer , like , to think about cancer , a lot more people than i do .
the part of the genome we can read is the list of the ingredients .
it &apos;s a huge amount of information in genetics by just comparing the genetic firewall .
and i , &quot; okay . at least this guy is very connected . &quot;
so we &apos;re basically measuring every single one of the most remote than a own one .
if you have malaria , we give them a little bit of them , or some of the most little things that are .
where we really have to get to the process , which is just going to be , and that &apos;s the level of the activities of the world , why the body doesn &apos;t even care about it , how does it normally make it ? &apos; &apos; em ? &apos; &apos; em ? &quot;
danny hillis : cancer
they all are members in tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to give these people to just give .
because on stage three , most of us are .
that &apos;s their lobby .
there was no plan . never before anybody tried to try and do this .
in fact , martin luther king was a member of the number three .
so i &apos;m sitting here in this chair , and i don &apos;t do anything . &quot;
and suddenly they got the most , and tried to figure out , &quot; how do we ask the population of sub-saharan africa ? &quot;
automatically we &apos;re going to get the little piece of plastic up .
and these are the ones that were designed to be designed to be designed to be so much of the control to the ground , to the ground that they are not as a permanent building .
they &apos;re going to be the stability and security that can offer the lap of a uncle , you compare them to the educational construction of a computer &apos;s construction .
but from my perspective , compassion has a problem .
and it &apos;s the most powerful form of the brain &apos;s gratification .
i can &apos;t really explain it , and he doesn &apos;t .
stories like this , sign like this , are practical aid in a world that &apos;s going to be able to get compassion , the ones that are otherwise allowed us to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
gandhi was also a really powerful person .
and the first day , our favorite day , our favorite , taught us our motto , which we had to put every day for the rest of the summer to make the sanitary pad .
this is one of two or three of their known known .
here are some examples .
it turns out we can &apos;t be part of a group without a group of the other , without the other thing to mimic .
so that &apos;s the world that we live today .
and so i &apos;m trying to learn from my grandfather &apos;s example to my grandfather &apos;s way .
okay , number two : go to the wild .
and imagine that , you &apos;re doing a internal picture : i was born in a very small village in mexico , unfortunately , very , very much of the circumstances , and my parents had no higher school .
and so we believe that through all the changes that are happening , we &apos;re going to see incredible opportunities today .
it &apos;s a initiative that &apos;s on simple , and it &apos;s a lot of solutions .
we &apos;ve sent 30 different technologists to 18 different countries , and we were able to connect millions of people to connect to what this particular segment needs and requires .
and on my favorite , my father came to me and said , &quot; you know , i remember that every generation has to make it better than the previous .
i know many people who are very smart and yet say , &quot; why can &apos;t i solve my problem ? &quot;
i started to start with a different family .
don &apos;t you believe that we have the responsibility to take the environment seriously ? &quot;
i still go to the same four years old , like , before .
but that &apos;s not a good life .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s praying .
whether they believe them or not , it doesn &apos;t make a difference for me now .
so he said , &quot; what do you think in your hand ? &quot;
what &apos;s this in your hand ? &quot; -- i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball , and this basketball represents your identity , which you &apos;re .
when my children were small , i was always in her room , sat on her bed and looked at my children at sleep .
it &apos;s less than i had -- i was embarrassed with three to 10 million -- but yet it &apos;s a very significant number .
in a village , we then have 100 laptops , every one with a different collection of 100 books , so that the village suddenly has 10,000 books .
right , the famous chinese characters for the most famous .
you answer the question : how does it feel that you &apos;re concerned about that ?
we really learn this really bad lesson .
think about a moment of how it &apos;s , in the right .
and unlike all other animals , we &apos;re obsessed with trying to figure out it .
and i have to tell you that i thought i write this incredibly compact book about a subject that everybody hate , for a audience that would never give you .
the effect of it is not just the only thing that &apos;s not just the other of the wheat , but mountains of grain .
1986 came out of vietnam after america .
the answer was , &quot; that &apos;s even worse . &quot;
our most of the average sank on the average of the average in our industry , and in the five years of the optimal , our most of the the most devastating .
and bhutan , for the ones that don &apos;t know , is the youngest democracy of the world , only two years old .
it &apos;s actually that we &apos;re often going to hunt in the west , as if it was lucky , that we have to capture a thing , or maybe several things that we need to get .
and we ask 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s simplicity .
what we really need to learn as leaders is that we can affect the production of production by creating the right conditions that we can do with your employees .
bl : okay . one , two , three .
under a deck of deck , you tell your inner gas , you move you . but the eyes are moving in the grasp of the boat , and say , &quot; i &apos;m silent . &quot;
amy , come up to the top ?
the method : what did you do ? the result : what have you seen ?
i just read one .
real scientific education should give people a voice and they &apos;re allowed to express this , and that &apos;s why amy is the last word in this short story .
poor people have not been the opportunity of choice .
we were flying down in the &apos; 70s .
and to come there , we have to realize that the principle of a computer is not just the way we &apos;ve talked about it , but also our society is going to be able to do .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure somebody &apos;s already asked , &quot; yes , great things up there -- but how do i come up there ?
i was a professor at the most of the time , and i got a lot of attention to this , and that allowed me to fund the start of the program .
we have eight engines in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart , they fall apart and end up here .
i mean , people ask yourself whether cell phones are safe .
you have a leap .
because , remember the original idea of dr. &apos;s , the mobile phone of his wife .
and for those who can &apos;t read it , it &apos;s like , &quot; it seems like it &apos;s actually a kind of wireless technology . &quot;
green or natural , which is not going to be a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the existing millennium in our bodies .
first , a more , a , , with a , , with the most remote death of death , &quot; the &quot; the death death . &quot;
and i learned , i learned who he was really .
i &apos;m looking for an cure .
i say , &quot; hold it alive when you can . &quot;
even with this kind of piece of paper in our hands , we &apos;ve always defined hope again .
but a feature .
suddenly he knows that he was interrupted .
to give you this , we need to put them back to the driver &apos;s driver .
we &apos;re going to be the area , we &apos;re sending it to people , we sent people to the building , we were helping the building of inside , which is the most important thing , and we helped the first one , and the rescue .
if i do this , i don &apos;t lose the original details . in the opposite , i could write history .
you &apos;re going to think about the public opinion .
this is not particularly good .
and what &apos;s a democracy that is .
here &apos;s the question : what country is going to be cut better , china or india ?
because the indian man has a advantage of two years of life in the indian woman .
what political change is , they &apos;ve introduced them .
china , i think , has always some amazing , more , more promising , and most of the other , in terms of social capital , public health , a sense of equality that &apos;s not there in india .
it was a place where people with a full origins and with different kinds of things and the different things .
and now they have the problem that they spent all the money to afford help with this advanced electronics in these countries and now all of it is useful .
a little chaotic environment where many ideas came where people were more , interesting , interesting , more interesting , more interesting , more of the other data .
about a or two decades ago , a wonderful thing was called howard &apos;s name , and read darwin &apos;s notebook from this period .
they &apos;re going to be in their colleagues , but everybody said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be done .
does the other other things go ?
in the 1970s , this was a percent of the national income in the united states .
many of these political factors can be parallel in the category , &quot; capitalism , political , political , which help a group of good things , but actually nothing good for the rest of us .
as you can see right , how globalization and technological revolution can create this global rule of money , it &apos;s much harder to mention all the time .
so they invest meaningful amounts of time and tools to train their children .
we created the modern world system , and we &apos;ve created the modern
this is his little hand .
and we &apos;re going to be all dying of it .
this was a huge disappointment for us , because we believed in a new development .
i even believe that places like oregon , where you take care of medical school , and a toxic dose can be eaten , just half a percent of people ever did .
so long talk short : they came to canada .
but i also heard about cancer as most of the most popular disease of our time , how the good and the bad thing together ?
some articles even went to say that skeletal muscle is resistant to cancer , and beyond , not only cancer , but it &apos;s about the fact that metastases spread in skeletal muscle .
16 percent ! that &apos;s that there were these kinds of tumors in skeletal muscle , but only 16 percent of the actual metastases -- which is the muscle that may be able to control angiogenesis , the angiogenesis that are able to control these blood vessels .
this is a very far idea of the idea , but i really believe that it &apos;s possible .
after that , my translator left me .
she was the girl who was in the broken of the other for her team .
and i wrote a letter on my best friends in atlanta , georgia , who had 11 to a son .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot; i asked the translator .
so the two came to lunch , and we were thrown out of the restaurant .
he had children from very korea in their lives , and he found families for them .
they have a lot of time about the dictionary .
so i open this window , look out , look out , and see how fire of the hotels are going to shoot in the altitude .
so we ran into the bathroom , and we took it to the face and they were holding our faces and the children .
until the adoption . a year ! what &apos;s going on there ?
this is their favorite .
this is sydney , who &apos;s going to be three years old .
but there was no evidence .
there are little planets , there are bigger planets , there are big planets , okay .
but there &apos;s a lot more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something that depends on themselves ?
and this deeper , more , more , is the point that science is , the science , how we know it , to define new .
okay , let &apos;s say , this is the size of the most important universe , with all the galaxies , all of the stars , okay , from here .
thank you very much .
look at : while uganda goes down and zimbabwe , russia went to a percent .
they find the highest hiv guess in the world in african countries , and yet they find in senegal , here , the same rate as in the united states .
look at kenya .
it could be something else , which is more likely to be more likely to be .
we know about a hundred billion people ever lived .
that wasn &apos;t just a economic story .
and the result is even a bigger divergence in a shorter period than it was in germany .
it &apos;s just with institutions .
they have to give me food . &quot;
he was wrong .
now , i want to end with three questions to the future billion , shortly when the united states is losing their place as a number of economy .
no , we &apos;ll probably get a breath , regardless of the giant , the vast of the big , which we have , regardless of the signs that we &apos;ve lost our work , and other parts of our historical system .
allison , thank you .
there are many kinds of silk silk .
spider silk is almost completely entirely made of protein .
the fibers that can make a single spider , are quite diverse .
also , a high potential of their ability to be a high potential to the ability .
what i want to do is not be the mermaid , so you might like to be so lovely , but on the photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there are more photos . there are more photographers .
that sounds alien in our ears , but what happens is that 80 percent of the ribs have been supported much more .
the first thing happens when you &apos;re a problem , that the first goal of the institution is immediately changing by what the goal is to be able to do .
the inventor don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states that try to figure out if bloggers journalists are journalists or not .
she was created by using their own , the use of many of these tools , and no afford to do the intelligence of the world today in the last week .
you have a lot of the time , which is probably for us the most devastating part of the bread or the fibers , because it &apos;s just full of fibers , because it &apos;s just from fibers .
everything is on his place . first level .
we call it &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but let &apos;s look at the different steps , under the point of the way that the possible connections of the species of the species is to be a deeper level -- my search is the answer to the answer to what is so special ?
this is transformation , two different things .
and if you &apos;re shaped , you go back to prove that they &apos;re alive , and character .
if you do this bread , you can use any kind of life from every beer .
it will be a kind of a kind of kind of a kind of kind of thing that we &apos;re working on by these talk .
it takes a very , very long , very long , these scores , and i work on a piece of time , which is 180 pages long , and that &apos;s a big part of my life and i &apos;m going to get the hair .
it &apos;s going to quote by brian &apos;s , which is an extraordinary artist .
you have a little taste of the piece of the piece .
what we did -- the caregiver of my students , one of my students , and i gave the babies two teas to eat : a bowl with a sunny broccoli , and a bowl with a bowl of the water .
i mean , last time we look at babies , they appear pretty useless .
and our babies and children are much longer dependent on us than the babies every other species .
the most , it &apos;s bringing them to change the hypothesis .
now there are two things that are really interesting about it .
boy : so .
our consciousness is going to be extremely bright and consistent , and everything else is going to be like dark .
&quot; babies and little kids are like research and the human species , &quot; the psychologist says , &quot; the psychologist of the human species , &quot; and their research , as babies are playing , are going to make a subtle information and decisions .
if i could just take you a little demonstration of the difference , to show the difference -- because it &apos;s really pretty appropriate .
then you repeat this process and again , and again , until something , it &apos;s supposed to be the character , like i &apos;m walking straight .
what we really wanted to do was the whole human body .
so you can &apos;t do this .
here &apos;s a few simple scenes , like he got .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we &apos;ve done it yet .
some of the studio already use our software to do exactly the same , and we &apos;re going to get a few of our most big things in a few big ways .
we thought he just would keep the balance .
here &apos;s what you learn to go to the most remote -- as most of you hopefully know .
but i have to say , i &apos;m never going to forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i &apos;m convinced that art and creativity are essential to develop empathy .
if you &apos;re the lonely , you write a new york times , then you get hundreds of emails , most of what i &apos;ve been reported by today , and most of what i &apos;ve been reported by frustration .
some stories are just classic , and yet , so that &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
it &apos;s increasing . nobody bought it .
there &apos;s a border that we don &apos;t want to cross . so what is the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want a new , empty document in word .
but i think there are actually two microsoft letters .
the other products were supported by microsoft with a open standard , rather than apple &apos;s standard standard .
and the most , if someone writes a little bit -- what happens every day -- i say , &quot; &quot; adorable me . &quot;
but when i looked at the most of the technologies , nanotechnology , nanotechnology and other people come into the digital species , i made very big worried about the most big thing .
and to be able to get the danger of this new stuff , we have to be able to have the ability to be able to get the ability to make the access to the access to the access .
i think the challenge we &apos;re standing on -- i &apos;m very sure that this is going to happen -- the challenge is , will we develop this kind of thing with the background that &apos;s going to be able to draw us from this device ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , for example , you have all kinds of incredible properties .
and to give you a sense of the last of small , a little bit of little common fund -- he was going to go to 400 million dollars that &apos;s right for us .
and if you &apos;re going to use the concept of insurance , you can have a much more sophisticated resource -- the market of the market -- using feedback .
12 years ago , caves started to be too busy , and i was going to be my research in this direction .
so wonderful and grim things .
there are ice under the surface .
so they &apos;re a kind of a life form .
it &apos;s even so much energy for biology in this cave that there &apos;s actually a big number of water .
we can see them .
we realized a few years ago that caves have a lot of properties that were used by people and other organisms as a habitat .
whenever you have a goal , to the way you have to be able to get certain steps , certain people are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do .
and so it &apos;s also in archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
kiran were painted about it and it suffered under more sophisticated .
that means before we could start to digitize the most , we had to take the book apart .
and this is what it looks like .
but by flying through the electrons with light speed , they give up .
this was a bad idea , because philip from unaids had a son named alexander &apos;s son , and they lost the battle of the world &apos;s battle .
because the moment is institutions are going to be the data with the data and so more .
the original owners of the bottle was one of the most talented people &apos;s 18th century .
i asked myself , 160 dollars for what ?

a lot of a scheme is that many of these things come from japan -- they &apos;ll notice it .
i mean , a computer , a little bit of the toilet .
there was a object that i couldn &apos;t get into the finger , and that was the most unhealthy puppet of nixon .
and i can &apos;t -- call my taste the one of the one -- so it &apos;s not necessarily significant that i wasn &apos;t impressed , but i wasn &apos;t the only one there , with this reaction .
and at the beginning of this year , a virtual asteroid sold for a lot of real dollars .
the really interesting thing about puerto pear is that you can measure them .
well , i could create a game with the name of the name by just bringing a million pies , or a thousand pies .
if it &apos;s real boxes , we can &apos;t do much , but in a game , we say , &quot; ok . &quot;
this is absolutely crucial and thom is amazing in it .
and i want to tell you a quick story , in 1999 -- there was a video game called the video game .
it &apos;s about how individual engagement can be transformed by the psychological and neurological insights that we &apos;re going to see when we &apos;re watching people playing in games .

this is a kind of a , which i have two years ago , which was one of the largest projects i &apos;ve ever been involved with and my company .
but i &apos;m going to be able to go on the beginning of the process , three very much .
if we &apos;re so good , what we &apos;re doing , we shouldn &apos;t be able to create an architectural manifestation that absolutely dirty through the most remote and the world &apos;s basis ?
the architectural is , the architectural thing was , just said .
and this is the real living of the hard .
the second technology we use is , we use things that you know from the world &apos;s favorite opera .
here you see the most the the ones .
i &apos;m going to talk about how to commit stories to something else .
one of these projects is about a year old .
this is the images automatically created .
so as long as i was awake , i had the camera to the neck .
you can see a timeline that shows you the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s a lot of the time . well , further .
a car fly of a computer &apos;s mouth .
a senior man , the farmer farmer .
what if you had a year , what would you do , what would you do the next 35 years of your life ?
&quot; money deserve and open a business , &quot; the indian was the indian .

if someone had seen in 1973 on a black board of 1993 , the most different one was a little different for time , but he had understood what was there .
i &apos;m about the most of the time , i wanted to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you can look at my work next week , and also in the most remote room in the world &apos;s own .
afghanistan doesn &apos;t think of existential threat for global security .
and the same thing is true for the troops .
instead , there was a bloody bias of the optimism optimism .
diplomats dig up in the world .
and finally , we need to understand that the secret of what we did in bosnia and kosovo , the secret of our success to the big part of our humility -- in the careful way of our mentor .
rory , she mentioned libya to the end .
so here you see two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger to show you fundamental , how it looks .
there are also a lot of the things that are going to be the most profound thing , but if you &apos;re these of these things , this is used for another kind of a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of a kind of a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of a kind of
the most difficult thing . this is a difficult problem that i &apos;m not going to be going to be going to be .
there &apos;s another one , very interesting connection , and this is that what you want to do is to lead more valuable information on a general system .
so , i think it has the minimal food that we can probably do to make things .
and we decided that we should not think about this very much in terms of the cost , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book that means , &quot; what &apos;s the most important thing to do in kansas ? &quot;
so we need to ask why .
but nonetheless , you don &apos;t interact much with people who don &apos;t like to be like yourself .
so we can think about things like the most remote .
i &apos;m kidding , but half , if i say you &apos;re going to believe that you &apos;re going to believe that you &apos;re going to believe in the hospital , if you get a missing model , mri and the most popular .
then bell &apos;s going to be on his students .

religious health .
harder is to move the dead to a answer .
my friend simon bezos , a computer , was writing , writing the book &quot; the big bang &quot; etc . &quot;
and now they open their eyes .
you can completely open it up , and it &apos;s a lot of the time .
but it &apos;s been inspired me to think that these guys , at least most , know what they do for living .
all of this thought that .
you can create lots of change . you can build roads .
and that &apos;s something that people want to do .
you don &apos;t need everyone .
hugo &apos;s got the most popular , and in venezuela , in venezuela , it &apos;s not invented .
and so it goes on .
they connect people .
the reason ? the modern medicine today uses a 60 years old .
there &apos;s another catch .
it &apos;s going to make it a faster time , over 26 times less than the current , and over 400 times more than our current , for pancreatic cancer .
and my experience with islamic world are very different .
there are for example , for example , the character .
and why does sex lead to babies , and why is babies in relationships a erotic disaster ?
because it &apos;s the secret of the desire .
especially important to this description of the other or my self -- that &apos;s the same -- particularly interesting , that there &apos;s no more kind of thing in desire .
this is your favorite and drawn , that &apos;s biology , the natural instinct .
then , the desire begins . this is what curiosity takes , and this is what curiosity needs .
you know that there &apos;s an acute space that &apos;s heard every single one .
other places in the country had similar spaces .
in a computer cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
ok .
that &apos;s mostly played in smaller rooms .
so early people have some of the questions .
so i asked myself , ok , is this a model for design , that adaptation we practice ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned to me and said , &quot; there &apos;s me .
how do we solve the following three problems that i want to bring here to language ?
albert einstein -- i just put myself with somebody when i thought a talk , and i met mr. einstein .
what is it about life ? why am i here ?
i never read a talk or a talk or a lecture .
and it was about 300 people .
he talked about his personal experience .
a french historian said two centuries later : &quot; rarely , a little bit of a sense of the authority of jesus christ . &quot;
or he was what he was asking .
i &apos;m not going to be able to relax about the most popular of the most popular .

i failed .
i want to look at 20 years of now and see that there &apos;s a little girl , a , nigerian girl , nigerian girls on this ted stage .
lg : like .
and in 1996 , computers can do the necessary thing to do , to make insights and decisions .
every interaction is recorded by more sensors : their phone , their credit card , their computer . it &apos;s a lot of data and we get the opportunity to understand our own .
these records were human favorite .
by a time , it &apos;s introduced to what else is a task for 40 people about three months , became a simple task for three people in 40 hours . that &apos;s all the time of the world &apos;s most wins .
we should stop seeing out .
dinner with my wife and the kids go home .
because people say , &quot; shit man , i don &apos;t want to get a time . &quot; you want to be .

so i thought that would be an opportunity to use scratch to make a interactive map for my mother .
but i &apos;m skeptical , what this kind of thing is .
in this case , you take a little bit of a time , put it on a stack and the pile of the different characters in a game or a story , in this case that &apos;s the great fish .
if you learn to code , you can code to learn .
if kids like a lexicon like vivian , they learn to learn important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s just the beginning .
what i want to talk about today to give you a background is that cars are art .
i want to talk about it .
and i think that this thought that great cars have a soul , very useful , is , you know , you know , you know , a car with soul in the first sight . you know how strong it is .

what he didn &apos;t explained was why entropy was ever low .
unlike the low entropy of the early universe , even though we don &apos;t know the answer to it , we have a good theory , that can explain that , if this theory is true , and that the theory of the dark energy .
and so it will be , although the universe gets forever , and ordinary matter and radiation will be getting away , and they &apos;re getting a certain amount of radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even in empty space .
but we also give it big fluctuations .
it turns out .
it &apos;s a bacchanal that you accept and not question .
i had never used a computer .
it was a future that i couldn &apos;t accept .

and some are in every case to be able to use them for the battles .
our strong response to images , to the expression of feelings in art , is going to be the beauty of music in the sky , and our offspring are as long as human race .
well , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see this , like the computer , the environment , and you can &apos;t see the terrace , we can actually see the driver with red leds , so he can actually see what &apos;s going on .
even if mark can avoid you .
or for blind people , in everyday devices in the household , in education and office .

and the ordinary astronomers were full of contempt about it .
because it &apos;s the way that the way that life can live out there , it has tremendous benefits compared to life on a planet .
there was another object , this high , high furniture of events and the naked , and naked -- pretty creepy things for a small child .
the first projects were modest , but they took technology and they might be able to get them into things that are going to use people to a new kind of function and maybe a new functionality .
the other thing that is the most important thing is that we decided that we decided that all the technical implants are , this whole , and tried to make it beautiful .
so we called it y water water , so that &apos;s another example , which is all in a room , which is the three-dimensional design , the ideas that are the development of the brand , it &apos;s all deeply interconnected .

now , the question : if i just watch how a different person is touched , why am i not confused and i have this kind of the driver &apos;s naked , how someone will touch ?
thank you . i have two of the things here today .
i don &apos;t really go to the most of the time , but it &apos;s about the pollen itself .
all these images were taken by a base scan by kew in the lab by kew .
even every single one of us has a story to tell the most of us .
we need to be so good like breast cancer , to address this crisis .
and at the time , in the 1980s , when we &apos;re going to get women and death through heart disease , she wrote a breath for the new england journal of medicine and called the syndrome .
our colleagues in washington , d.c. d.c. , d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike the , x-ray , x-ray , for women , whose chest , their chest , the heart of the heart . every time we organize something that includes just a little bit of radiation , we &apos;re going to say , &quot; is this test really necessary ? &quot;
okay , here we started .
they did what they said , they &apos;ve thought they were going to have been held and went to the tracks .
the cells have something like this , and the dish is not feeling .
what does that mean for us ?
in the run of three years , we took eight to 10 hours , about a quarter of a quarter of a quarter of a quarter of a quarter of the day , and the most remote .
this is one of the first most popular ones that came out of a year ago .
and finally , my son is going to play in a walker .
three of the most important people in this project , philip , is to see , and they &apos;re a little bit of the most important .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamic in the game .
this is the first time that our son was more than two steps on once -- captured in the movie .
and that &apos;s a important question to the question , because the better we understand how the brain is making meaning , the better we can communicate . i think the better we can think of it and work .
it &apos;s a kind of center where you see a picture and think &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional response to the learning . &quot;
what we literally do is to paint our teams , to paint the whole thing on a big wall .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just about cheetah , but also the possibility for relaxation .
so there &apos;s not a lot of it .
if you put this in the building industry , if you have a computer , and a window is broken , we say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken , that &apos;s necessary .
this is the difference .
so we continued to put it on .
are we just stupid ?
you might be able to put it into two years , if you read eight hours a day .
so , you can say , in september , and say , &quot; i &apos;m important today .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
and the police waiting for the fire to cut the vehicle into pieces of the driver to get the body of the driver .
and that &apos;s enough to the present with the present in the united states , which is a eye of the divine .
all of that leads us -- the most , just to name that , which is what we &apos;re doing most of the time , digital devices .
this is the consequence of destruction of the destruction of the brain on the right , through the stroke .
this is a very , very low level to be recorded from health care .
he was holding my jaw in the right position while he was going to be my teeth .
alfred man is a brilliant physicist and willie , who is fascinated by that , gaps to close to the extra gaps , whether he &apos;s wearing a deaf , or a blind , or a blind , or a paralyzed , the movement .
now i had to go in the dark years , which followed , figure out what was going on when everything was doing that , was gone .
and it works . it works .
lp : so if you have the opportunity , you spend time with simon .
and these were the developing countries : they had big families and a relatively short life .
and these are on this side . a big embryo of africa and the most of the world &apos;s .
and then deng xiaoping came and brought money to china and brought the country back to a middle of the middle .
one search of search that we can copy the data in a kind of a structure and publish the world , and what do we hear when we look around ?
but this creates hypotheses .
you know , darwin has explained that life after it was made , what was the essence of life ?
and i learned francis crick .
but there was what in the literature .
we were not the best chemist in the room .
i was unhappy ; my girl didn &apos;t married me .
you can compare dna to this kind of dna and compare the way to be able to compare .
and so i &apos;m going to close , by telling you that we &apos;ve looked at 20 people with schizophrenia .
average , the defense costs in a case of two million dollars , and takes 18 months if you win .
first , they don &apos;t fight it at the patent , but against the most remote .
my solution : give me this patent and i &apos;ll leave you with a little bit of the time .
&quot; why not ? &quot;
the fathers were on a place where they move their daughters to play their chairs , their chairs and their hand to dance .
this is a great technology .
it &apos;s not very much left on the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in people .
can &apos;t see the enemy most time , and we needed a different approach to eradicate polio as we had to do with smallpox .
it helped to control pandemic , historically , to control sars .
the reality of polio today is something very different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : now bruce , where are the most difficult places ?
bruce
dj : we found this route now at all kinds of animals , especially at the cats .
and to our surprise , it was a kind of a more .
for us , this elephant is a symbol of inspiration , a symbol of this hope , which is accompanied us in our work .
it was incredibly amazing than she took it in security to protect it before the hyena .
and of course , if i look at this kind of thing , the most , the most , she reminds me to a lot of a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic because your destiny is in our hand .
we need it . we respect and celebrate each other as a man and woman , as a community and as part of this planet and we need to continue to continue .
and then , obviously , it seems to be that the earth is big and quiet , the sun , and it &apos;s worth , but it &apos;s worth what &apos;s going to be called the most important thing to do .
and that &apos;s the way in middle world &apos;s middle of the womb .
nature &apos;s nature depends on what kind of animal we are .
because there &apos;s so many of them , and because between them not a consensus , there &apos;s no consensus on their own , and the most , like we see it in middle middle , and it &apos;s found .
people as machines like to treat scientific and they &apos;re just going to be a little bit of a waste of waste , but it &apos;s a waste of waste , if you want to guess what the person is going to do next .
i was in the gulf of the age of 40 years old .
over a cursor i control with my head , i allow this to see this kind of thing , videos from the robot and to send orders by sending buttons into a computer .
with people like you can do this dream .
in the crutches , for example , a kind of a lexicon is developed by the most , by the way , by basically the most , the dolphins send , and they put the dolphins .
i think we can form a global community .
this is a hot hot system .
now there are some -- there are some lessons that you can learn from it .
but normally we don &apos;t do this .
i think we tend to be able to look at this : infrastructure of globalization .
this is now down to 12 percent .
this is a problem that we need to solve .
i also take that most of you don &apos;t speak chinese -- what really sad is when you think that this is the most common language in the internet .
what do you look at ? maybe we should do that .
if you look at this picture , you might think , &quot; why should i care about that ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and find the world and find its place in it .
they would bring wealth and security , religious violence , and make sure states never had to terrorists .
and part of this activity is honesty .
what is this ?
i love this dish .
and the war is vaccinated , the 20 million people took life -- until today &apos;s civil war .
and leibniz gourley , who is this guy : &quot; i would have made all of this money , but i &apos;ve spent all these time , the american man who had stolen my recipe .
chinese restaurants have been mostly done , i would argue , with the slope and the admiration -- even the restaurant -- but without a centralized headquarters .
in contrast , we have general tso chicken , which started in new york city in the early 1970s , when i was in the university of new york city , so ...
so what we &apos;re seeing in the 17th century is the most , the world &apos;s search search , and the same search of medicine is going to be causing the same .
so people would have a really big advocate .
when the leviathan missile started to become less , i always became more depressed until i thought my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
do you remember , when a child is going to have to go on every line ?
in 18 and 19 , i slept with the night .
and again , i &apos;ll be a little depressed and a little bit of a decent .
so , many of us are clear to do a lot of the time in the next few years .
he goes around : &quot; how does it feel free to be free ? &quot;
you know , where did the world work in the treatment of the known problems that are made from the potential of the earthquake and climate change ?
if you &apos;re the impossible to do it , you can do it .
but we &apos;ve reached a agreement to climate change .
and there &apos;s god .
the most remarkable thing is , you use two ingredients , proteins and water that are in their grasp to create a material that is extraordinary to create a material as a friction .
or you &apos;re going to be beautiful things like this , if the camera can capture this .
here you see , how it &apos;s taken from tissue .
with my new project , mush , i want to use art for this , technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that &apos;s going to be able to pay that to the address and the round of the applause and the air of the world -- hopefully not to help him to help some of his next decisions .
what do i do ? &quot;
in the frame of this , the silver demonstration is , heather knight , a little bit more , which can be far more than a more , more than a more , the feedback of his audience and his behavior is the answers of the amount of things .
stanley harris , inventor of the known , the known of the known , is , in the most remote , and the most remote , that it was between two people , in fact , a connection to five to seven steps .
how does our view of relationships change in the way of relationships ?
but there was a exchange that i &apos;m going to tell you , and where he might have been able to put this out of the ear .
um ... my father , a computer , a computer ?
it was his father who decided they needed false papers .
this feeling of responsibility , and he had the other of the other members of the life , and he had his fault of 17 years , and he also his fault , a computer , because he was left from a camp , he kept his whole life .
and as my photographic and my favorite , i thought , was a way of being able to admire my father wrong papers .
i asked him to do the victim that he had ever been brought to if he ever had the most successful .
we grow from a few million people on the seven billion people that we are today .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a beautiful system on the ground , a more of the time , which is a very good one to the next of the world , which seems to be in a good state .
if you &apos;re the forests , the border in the district of the land is going to be able to stay , you can get the ability to stay stable .
with the realization of the knowledge of the , fishermen , the great great barrier reef , and scientists that the great barrier reef is the great barrier reef .
but the drama is , of course , that it &apos;s clear that the change is not an option .
that leads me to another reason why i &apos;m here today : because i really like media .
this is a race of a race from a race of far developed .
and he first use an ancient kind of manufacturing , which is the most profound and connected to this with three-dimensional perspective , which was a whole new technology .
and by the process of sugar on black , i hired portraits of them .
it was very big images and i took them to a very large camera , a little bit of a camera camera .
my interest on the world &apos;s interest , especially worse , is very far .
on the back , a sequence is also the chimps .
we can ask , is there general differences between africans and the most remote ?
and then you can compare it to the genome today .
so we can then ask us the same questions , how for neanderthals : do you mix with ancestors today ?
there are many people who designed their own vision of vision , like this vision of the beginning of the 20th century .
after my belief , the airplane of the future has his own consciousness .
imagine , carbon dioxide grow in 3d 3d , and they &apos;re embedded in a more of the way , and follow the forces that are in their components .
they didn &apos;t speak . but especially they were extraordinary from the world around them , from their environment and from people .
they would be a lot of the police . they would call the police .
now we know that it &apos;s about 100 .
you see a video on , you see a video .
you have the feeling that the research you have , really , has a effect on reality , that they can actually prevent these experiences to prevent my way to this area .
then you go off .
and you &apos;re going to be in a stare at a body body -- chin on the top of the world , poor , poor over your own own .
they did all this as we had taught them .
and after the battle , they bring this mobile record and make that what you call &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people have changed .
i said , &quot; where is he now ? &quot;
this is not a sound .
and she showed the left work to tell me how problematic this picture was , that it was for you to the idea of how black was represented .
it &apos;s really in this sense of the most remote , that i have a new series of questions that i &apos;m going to be .
well , there &apos;s kind of a obvious statement .
and the kids said , &quot; how should we do that . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to multiply numbers .
so i said , &quot; how did you do that , before you decided you &apos;ve got nothing ? &quot;
their favorite , they increased 50 , which is different schools in delhi with a more of the time of biotechnology .
was soluble percent . the test , two months later , was the result of the width of the year .
after eight ted talks , he wanted to be there .
these are a little bit of .
and i suddenly saw out of the darkness on the opposite side of the space , a kind of mirrors that were thrown from the moon .
if i had to reduce the whole story on a picture , what would it be ?
i &apos;m going to show you some clips from my other big project in this year . &quot; the tempest &quot; -- the storm .
and our little life ends up in a sleep .
bono : you &apos;re immortal .
i know you understand that .
so blue , blue , everything was blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both games in africa .
it &apos;s another one that acts in the interface of health and business .
let &apos;s use the markets as the most remote , which we have , and find out what price is the people who would pay to pay the choice .
thank you .
the most , the most , was that if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we destroyed two main and 10 tv .
the little little bit of the way to remove out of his trace , and that was a problem .
this is very good . it &apos;s going to slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of a few of the models that i work with .
tissue of the density of the density and behavior is the second part , and that &apos;s actually going to be the key to use these models for the most important .
thank you .
and the attempt to do it is to take a arrow with the end of the end of the end of the end , and it was hard work , and young , young , i learned a lot of respect to nature .
now let &apos;s look at the other side .
we work on projects -- even more , more sophisticated developments , as a result of the way -- with darpa , the california institute of technology and university .
be careful , behave just like wood or something like that .
now i didn &apos;t try to be a , to be a , to be .
they go forever .
these are over two billion .
it takes it to be about three years of the time .
don &apos;t forget that one of the things that a quarter of a calculator .
but for me , it &apos;s great because it &apos;s a metaphor for time , where we live in the human mind and machines .
i &apos;m very clear . where does it come from ?
it &apos;s to fear that the way that the way in the wild could extinction in 20 to 30 years .
all evidence of this is that this cancer is going to be protected by a virus .
i took the opportunity true and took a few samples from jonas &apos; tumor and a few samples from other parts .
she brought him to the final and that discovered something called a little bit of a little bit .
and ultimately , cancer is an inevitable consequence of the ability to share our cells and adapt to their environment .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and that &apos;s a global phenomenon .
they would be a lot of the time to wait for that .
and that &apos;s the third reason why a low expectation doesn &apos;t make us happy .
but they didn &apos;t feel that the numbers on them are the numbers .
first i &apos;m going to show you the most little of the bias for optimism .
but the good news is that our illusion is not broken when we &apos;re going to be aware of this kind of thing .
but what we &apos;re going to see in the 21st century is asia , which is incremental back to the world &apos;s population , and over half of the global economic economy .
you could look at this as the immigration of the war .
after 1900 , the soviets had been , &quot; it &apos;s the end of america . &quot;
if you live in japan or new delhi or the way you &apos;re going to be able to be a view of china , something else is going to be different than if you live in beijing .
and if we have strategies in which we &apos;re going to get this into bigger historic context , we can be able to do this process .
how do we define our national interests so that it doesn &apos;t only be a more of the most positive .
this is the conventional approach that &apos;s the conventional approach .
this is typically the responsibility to be able to guarantee the responsibility to guarantee a stable security policy .
they &apos;re the long time dependent on each other .
jobs for who ? especially for young men .
after mostly the legal system is collapsed , you can &apos;t even get access to it .
the care of the self would be the way that the conflict is to be a community .
this is the costumes of my hometown new orleans .
the military has realized it . they call climate change a more , which is the security and stability , as governments on the world , like to respond to the world .
it allows you to become more productive , so they can afford to do insurance themselves .
these are certainly inspiring examples of possible solutions if we feel in the situation for a way to plan to plan a world .
listen to chinese students , english students practice by calling it .
teachers : perfect ! students : perfect !
and that &apos;s what things like the concrete world with the world &apos;s most remote , abstractions , which we try to make logical consistent , and we also take the hypothetical seriously , which is what it might be like .
luria looked at people before they were in the scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to a walkable world .
there was luria : there &apos;s always snow .
they chose a lot of new york instead .
it wasn &apos;t just the spread of cognitively heavy professions .
would you have made it , killed ? &quot;
they could say , a half .
it feels like i landed in a colony of angels . &quot;
and they &apos;re going to be able to do a degree in something .
it &apos;s still in the red numbers , but chris made it personal victims , this film .
i &apos;m one of your favorite favorite .
there &apos;s a prime minister , a minister of secretary , secretary , a pit , or president of the world &apos;s .
boy : &quot; the most serious thing is serious .
we were all mad on them : &quot; why do you do that ?
that &apos;s a lot of real , if you read it . &quot;
we &apos;ve been playing the game for weeks for weeks , about seven weeks , and we had all 50 to the process of all 50 .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
many people announced good jobs and closed the most , and they were closed .
it &apos;s like his own little connection .
if i all have three legs of this , in the three peaks of the triangle , i would get a marker .
so everything you &apos;re doing is -- it &apos;s a very powerful case -- this old , old , and this old plastic , &#91; unclear &#93; . this is a very simple one in a old world .
that &apos;s possible if you have a whole piece of paper , and you can get a continuous paper -- you can be in a school school or in a state school -- a sheet , a bullet , a pencil , no scissors .
what we do is a very simple thing .
this is a little tube , which is what you do , this two corners here , it &apos;s going to be a little bit like a car .
here are two magnets .
it was very many passengers on the ship , and they became boring , so the captain she was invited to be a deck .
in the world conference , the wilbur gupta shows simple , and yet amazing plans to actually turn waste into really a very , good constructed toys , which can build children themselves -- while they learn basic principles of science and design .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually examples of biology that many evidence of the time .
and there &apos;s a few examples of projects that are aware of ecosystems .
and with a little planning , we can be dominated by traffic , in a turn , which provides open space for people who are bringing people back to food and waste waste in opportunities .
this photograph was done on the day of the day , and just a year later , it looked like this .
if you put seawater , the first thing is calcium carbonate .
no , you have to be able to explore people &apos;s people with visions of the ones . &quot;
i was looking for someone who is jewish because i &apos;m jewish and because i &apos;m very important .
but the real failure was that there was a lot of men who wanted to go to me .
very few of us have the ability to be absolutely honest with yourself .
he likes to travel as long as it &apos;s not on a computer .
i was basically trying to be like being a lot of the way .
because they remember my favorite , you have to get a more of 700 points of 700 points and nobody did this .
most of you . gamers are 33 years old , not eight years , and if we look at the demographics of the world &apos;s demographics , the players of tomorrow are older adults .
imagine whose vision is very , very good .
these gamers even have many other benefits in terms of attention , and a aspect of attention , which is also improved , is our ability to track objects in our environment .
i want to ask you to remember this result , and it &apos;s in the context of another group of the world &apos;s context , a group that actually looked at in our society , which is in our society .
let me explain this step with a task that &apos;s called mental being .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just make all kinds of programs of special , and we &apos;re looking at it .
so it was a big , very complex project that i didn &apos;t even know if it was working at all .
so wolfram alpha knows about many and many things .
and on one side , we have mathematica , with the kind of precise , talented language and a big network of the world &apos;s capacity to do a lot of lines .
so , with physical , we &apos;re sort of used to go to the world and see that certain materials are making sense of certain technological purposes and so on .
a few years ago , i was pretty excited about discovery that there are candidates with incredibly simple rules that are successful , which is a special relativity of relativity and gravity and gravity and gravity and gravity .
sw : i think .
and while i lost that time , i actually lost more relatives , and teachers who are going to be me , in hiv / aids .
they jump up . they wear red clothes .
and my mother was a woman , she didn &apos;t have a right on a property , and automatically was all my family , anyway , and i had the right thing , so he had the right .
and the day of the actual ceremony , we were dancing , were excited , and they didn &apos;t sleep all night .
he was wearing the little and that in a village that didn &apos;t even have a lot of the streets . it was very attractive .
i promised him to be a girl &apos;s girl , i would come back and do everything that you would ask from me .
when it was pregnant before marriage , mother was responsible for this , and punished .
as we speak here , 125 girls will never be adopted again .
consumers , the 72 percent of the american gdp , actually start , just like banks and companies , they &apos;re going to provide their own , in the everyday life , themselves , in the everyday life , and we &apos;re going to get to free ourselves .
and what you &apos;re seeing here is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we actually get to get out and basically future education , the future children of our households .
and the 10th is up 48 percent , the cornell institute .
we also observe a trend to something called tourism , right ?
one of them is the most important of community and neighborhood , and the remaining of the neighbors as support .
we also observe a big amount of a lot .
the trend is enormously powerful .
then we take the phenomenon of objectivity .
and then i came to the question , i &apos;m the only one that does something like this ?
you could use them .
that &apos;s what i do in my life -- stories tell you , novels , and today i want to share with you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also about some geometric creatures that are the most depressing .
our most of our favorite , our hearts could be more frustrating , and our own , and our most , if we &apos;re in the cultural world , is to be in our cultural world .
i was going to get to the first time i call it , &quot; sterile allende . &quot;
i &apos;m not an immigrant , no refugee or a half , and i &apos;m going to ask , why i do that . but that &apos;s what allows me to invent myself .
he wanted to see a manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story became a huge issue , because i was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do .
literature has to lead us to the other side .
i could be a novel about an muslim woman , and maybe that will be a happy story , and i might write about a little bit of a book , gay professor in norway .
so you &apos;re going to take a lot of existing songs , you &apos;re going to cut it into small pieces , put these pieces , they put them together and they get a new song , but this new song is clearly old .
instead , these laws and laws worldwide are more awkward compared to the property .
it &apos;s a kind of a more of the time , but i &apos;m going to summarize what it was going to cover . the head of the telephone , by the telephone , by the telephone , by the phone .
our creativity comes from outside , not inside .
and then you say , &quot; okay , but how do you see your address ? &quot;
but in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the newspaper &quot; guardian . &quot;
what &apos;s beautiful , you can probably see this limb there , a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a , which is made out of the limb .
our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
now , this led to an understanding of the nuclear structure , because it &apos;s going to be so much that atoms have a single core , with a little bit of the world that circle it down .
this picture shows a galaxy , a global , a , , , in , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think you can finally be the most important ideas for us , and we &apos;re also going to be the value of our space in the universe and really the value of our home .
this is here . this is home . that &apos;s what we &apos;re .
and with every mouse , and every touch of the screen we let the way the way we &apos;re going to get the and spears of our personal information all over our way through the digital forests .
when our daughter sat on the most remote , i asked them , &quot; will you put a lot of musical competence on musical competence ? &quot;
we can &apos;t do it in the process of the brain .
well , i want to take you on this journey .
and because i was so much upset and talked , i decided i was not going to talk to you more , i &apos;m not going to talk to you a day -- a day .
and they don &apos;t speak ...
and i explained to a friend that my sign understood that i was john francis , that i was not talking about life , that i was not talking about that , that someone would translate my sign .
well , i &apos;m going to go back to my backpack again .
i started talking to you , because i &apos;ve studied a lot of research .
but the most , the most , i was thinking i was thinking about every birthday about my silence , but never my decision , just to use my feet .
and i grew up and grew up in north korea .
sometimes i found little jobs in exchange against food .
i was constantly worried that i was going to be a moment and back again .
i felt so powerless because i had so much to eat in america , but my father died in hunger .
but i think that your gesture of love and care is also saving life of another joseph , and thousands of other people can change the hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings , but this was much stronger than i expected , and i was just going to make it easy to make a industrial scientist .
but then i was very disappointed with my job as an architect , because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for society , but for an unprecedented people , rich , the government , the government .
and then in the next year , 1995 , there was a big earthquake in burma in japan .
so i wonder what &apos;s a permanent and what a little bit of a sudden ?
but this is really necessary .
so we learn some of the most important things in our lives before we &apos;re born , even in the womb .
so fetuses actually learn the particular language that will talk to the world that they &apos;re born in .
it &apos;s going to get a mixture of the conclusions that are so capable of the way that the woman itself .
why should malnutrition lead to the womb of the womb ?
you can also see the other eyes with other eyes .
this trust in the world &apos;s most kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of essential .
the audience will be on the world &apos;s audience , which is very logical , but not with the voices of what happens to your eyes . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , you might even get us to smile .
you may remember that as the most remote , okay , okay . then when the biggest deal of all time is interviewed .
if you &apos;re a high animal in the creative , and somebody says , &quot; what do you do for the capture of hunger in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start a campaign ?
this is actually a strategy and i don &apos;t argue that strategy is playing a role .
for me , all of this was the music .
so if i use my software , the camera is the camera , and they &apos;re going to be able to get the place of the world &apos;s body . and you have a kite .
i remember the poor needed something a little bit more -- food , clothing , shelter -- what they didn &apos;t have .
i even felt a kind of shame of shame .
now , i heard it , i was excited about different reasons .
i was not even asked to be asked to be a donation , which is actually my kind of way .
it &apos;s about the most of the history of the poor and it &apos;s about giving a possibility to be able to make a possibility of what their dignity would be , a partnership , which is a traditional way of donation .
it &apos;s a very far combination of a combination , a very strong combination .
now , the beginning is still at the beginning and it &apos;s a very difficult thing to do with me , and it &apos;s very clear that it &apos;s just a vehicle .
how does the future look like humanity ?
now i &apos;m going to turn to the second big question : are we alone or there &apos;s other lives in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions that we &apos;ve done is that we &apos;ve done remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
see this .
here are photos of me .
the rate of all 18 months , every 18 months , and every single one of the most remote member of the world &apos;s .
but what about them ? what &apos;s going to do with them ?
they &apos;re in their tadpole over the sky and occasionally they &apos;re going to give people to experiments that were not allowed to agree their parents .
so we &apos;re interested in these things .
previous generations could not do these experiments at all .
and i found that the first technology was in the form of the city of the city .
and we can learn very much about it .
and i see a little bit of the child , and i try to protect my child , because with such a child , you don &apos;t even have a minister of a minister .
and secondly , she says that they had a flip gang , but some of the definitions of the burning of trees had been .
until now , our knowledge came from our ancestors in principle of adults , because the fossils , the most valuable , missing .
the most of the time , the origin of humanity is exploring the origin of humanity in the long ethiopia , and he talks about how he found the oldest skeleton of a slave child and what we can learn in africa .
and if all of the rules should be , you need a effective system to the gun , and it &apos;s a very effective system , because we &apos;ve been found in everything .
it &apos;s going to be considered a high lake , because the continent of the world &apos;s demands was except .
we need to work locally , but also all the ocean industry .
we need to create a new paradigm of careful and respect .
carol &apos;s name says , &quot; i would pay to pay to what i do . &quot;
this was a pretty good idea .
and to say , i &apos;m journalist , no a 12-year-old , so i want to design a sketch , like the present and the future .
finally , i think we have to think about whether we want to think that our reality is going to be -- and if , what it means for our idea of life and everything that comes to it .
it looks like oil spills .
the symptoms of the complex is that you have the strong and the most profound opinion , the right solution to have no matter how hard the problem is .
cesar and i tried writing a paper for the new york times and explaining how it works .
of course , we can .
and make a lot of money .
it &apos;s for example , for example , higher than the failure of americans .
we &apos;re going to try . probably all wrong .
and immediately , the way . &quot;
and it was always trying to be tried to be able to prove , but he could never prove the guess .
i &apos;m saying that our approach is not portable .
china wants to have this already achieved in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even keep down .
the future is possible .
yes , it will become ugly , and yes , it &apos;s going to happen -- with safety in our lifespan -- but we &apos;re more than able to overcome everything that &apos;s going on on us .
and here they come into play .
and what we need to think about is that if you dance in the sink , what &apos;s next ?
and we thought we can put these debt on our children , but imagine you &apos;re going to get you before .
everything else is a lot of the other .
this is the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what stage of development is the cell .
that should not be amazing or ?
everything we have is a lot of the time .
they &apos;re going to be able to focus on their own , maybe the sensitivity can increase a series of things that we can &apos;t do .
it &apos;s not 1,000 years in the distance .
we should be able to use these cheap , simple , simple , and nobody &apos;s using them for their children . &quot;
and here we can see this demographic .
we can &apos;t risk the trust of the customers .
he just got 500 and a thousand , and it could have been able to get 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a huge amount of water of the world who got them , and he said , &quot; come back in a week , if you &apos;re sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the way that the web is -- things we all talk about -- is a little less than 5,000 days old .
of course , there &apos;s the internet since more than 5,000 days -- but the web only 5,000 days .
so if we say , the machine we &apos;re going to be a lot of a sudden is a human brain , a human brain when we look at the rate , there are 30 billion years of the year .
now it &apos;s not -- if you do a chart and things in work , a word , you &apos;re not part of the web , but they will be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people will be the extended senses of machine . &quot; in a sense .
it &apos;s going to be on the level of parts or ideas , or words if you want to be cured .
the last point i wanted to talk about is the idea that we &apos;re going to be able to be .
third , it will be more ubiquitous , it will fill our entire environment and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i realized that the second one of jesus &apos;s favorite of jesus had been made that it was a sun &apos;s moon , and that i had been prepared specifically to become his favorite .
these are the dead of the most remote .
and it allows everything . it &apos;s all going to appear .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas , like we &apos;re going to get things out .
this is a project that we &apos;ve been completed in a huge way to be completed for a huge amount of a process that came directly from this process , it &apos;s the result of a variety of forces that are developing .
and that led directly to another project .
it &apos;s actually a false attitude because the hybrid is probably more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas are to make young people .
and finally , one of the most interesting projects -- a computer system .
everybody &apos;s going to be on his neighbors .
so as we have to pay school school .
so we have a big brain , a big advantage , because we can influence our environment .
my story , the two brains , it &apos;s the two brains , it &apos;s a surprise , our gut has a brain .
this is very , very important , because there &apos;s a lot of it .
we &apos;ve learned to talk to the big brain , taste and reward , as you know .
he said , &quot; you know , eventually , we were all like animals and then not . &quot;
these are men and women who can name themselves 250 stars today in the sky .
of course , the smartest monks said that .
the main record , the post , the sun is actually a kind of a , which is constantly the light that feeds the light on the sacred , which seems to be called the most , called the most , called the most remote .
if you pray for the dead , you do this with the hands that you &apos;re going to be up with the sky in the sky .
here &apos;s the place where the big mother has the most powerful mother in the world , which has the mountains and the country that has created the heart of the world .
it &apos;s unique of human imagination .
this material that you all know is , but i think it &apos;s more for toxic white stuff .
i &apos;m going to put it in , you fit there , because in a hundred years my body can go back to the earth .
it &apos;s a waste .
you can apply it anywhere in the world , and not to take care of the world or a lot of the way , because you have many alternatives .
first , they start atoms in a special bottle .
i &apos;ve launched a competition four years ago called &quot; dance your ph.d. . &quot;
my country is with 15 trillion dollars .
and that &apos;s -- -- that &apos;s a lot of more sophisticated than all the speakers and all the ones that come to me .
and she thought about my work on mathematical models , which should encourage a understanding of evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience may not -- from deep , cultural reasons , you hold it for boring -- and find another pattern more interesting -- fractals .
you can think about two types of thinking about it .
if you throw a coin , you get a sequence of head and number .
back to more secular , because of that you &apos;re busy busy .
and only in one percent of the time .
he &apos;s going to be a little bit of , &quot; i &apos;m going to take that to a sudden death penalty in a family . &quot;
not as unlikely as one in 73 million , but yet pretty unlikely .
the whole quality of quality , the most basic impact on the industrial process is carried by statistics .
the most , perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives , may have saved hundreds of thousands of lives around the world .
a smart power of injuries prevent injury because the electricity is always recognized until a smart , a smart .
but , on the other side , china is a kind of a kind of a word of the end of the world .
you have facebook , we have a lot of the time .
yet , the scanner can produce a very strong force , which is never there in the history of china .
so , that &apos;s why chinese &apos;s , as a real medium , is not just as a single headlines .
how a big ted , not ?
so in the last three years , in the last three years , it really changed , they really changed more and more transparent because they don &apos;t have access to the data .
more chinese , more chinese speech , and human rights as their blackberry , instead of a u.s. , rather privilege .
many of you know that the beethoven seventh symphony was .
i don &apos;t say you can &apos;t live a wonderful life .
girl : well , my sister can be pretty nerves .
the acoustics of music is much more complicated than the language .
this is a violin .
and it seems like his favorite , and it was the way that the death of death was , to try and find the cause of the death of the world , and his skull has been on the pages of the pages .
cl : joseph is phenomenal . he &apos;s brilliant .
if i &apos;m going to be a very special audience , i see a special audience .
in many countries , it &apos;s another thing .
in this critical point in the dutch history , my father was at the shore of the world &apos;s river near the world &apos;s .
the rate of civil wars and oppression has been down since the end of the cold war .
my soldiers use their weapons as a tool of peace .
peter van : why i took a gun
this program gets a form and then then go from 250 pieces .
this is a kind of a more of the time in the middle of the middle of the world .
you can &apos;t let &quot; not let . &quot;
i &apos;m very interested in both very interested .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example of this , but there &apos;s actually a theoretical inversion for why technology is developed in the way .
now evolution took hundreds of thousands of years , and because of this interaction , evolution used evolution in basically the technology to produce the next stage , which was the first step in technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; we can make good dimension of the third dimension .
over the last 50 years , we had 28 percent of the information technology in the information .
another big revolution is the most big .
to go back to our exponential growth of computing : 1,000 dollars of computing to the brain of a insect or a mouse .
and in the year , we will get the full colorful of these trends , and they have to be informed , how often the creationists have made in the form of technology -- faster and faster when we get to this point .
you can get blessing and reconciliation with themselves .
they &apos;re harder , they &apos;re harder , they &apos;re harder .
they were out of the most of the time .
because there &apos;s nothing inside there . well , it &apos;s not going to be here .
dopamine is apparently the stuff that is in connection with the most remote .
and we call schizophrenia .
and he was so friendly to post that and give us the resolution .
i mentioned in our little thought earlier , they &apos;re a functioning in the african plain .
the 11th 11th has a computer . it &apos;s a conspiracy .
and we have our own own , and we have a product of product .
i was not so good as he , but we did it , and we did it , the n of n , tracy , tracy , and bruce .
they always said , &quot; tells us the truth , &quot; and we give us .
musicians and activist peter shares his personal motivation , with the most of the time , with human rights , and tell stories of active to the human .
next , we asked us how that do that ?
he recognizes the problem and knowing with it . the dance is his own , which allows him to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
the beetle climb much less than they put out , when they &apos;re not wearing .
here &apos;s our favorite experimenter .
let &apos;s play a more of the time and watch what happens .
this is the universe of stephen hawking .
thank you .
and the argument that it &apos;s fun is that it &apos;s fun to fall into this big adventure , right with my experience .
or , &quot; nice . you know , my grandmother makes a preview next year .
so the whole purpose of the presentation is to convince that they are the entrepreneurs that they invest in , and a lot of money will be doing with it .
and next to the experience , a company to work or lead to a company -- that doesn &apos;t have to be a company .
there &apos;s no financially working in the world , which is not a problem .
from there , they take them with -- on a solid , good path to top . right from the beginning .
if i happen to know someone that has made a device that &apos;s like this .
no , they &apos;re not .
then you give me a quick , quick .
even if the competition works for old patterns ...
it was hopefully all positive , positive , positive , even positive .
if you follow my life , you will have a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , to make who you are and to bring emotionally .
i didn &apos;t know that , that &apos;s pretty cool .
statistically , one of them is a beetle .
if you &apos;re going to calculate something , you might have a effect on it .
and then if you have enough , you can click another link .
we &apos;re at the end of the table , the last place as the culture , innovation doesn &apos;t estimate .
so as we think and behave , our main power is broken .
we have a little meme of memes -- seriously .
but forgive me , the problems are not the problems of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the largest most popular ?
it &apos;s very compact .
our thinking is backwards .
through a turn of change , change , like transparency , change , like the example of the , and collaboration , collaboration , and not a lot of things , these things are focused on results .
because only the challenge is the only way that things are going to be done , the only way to get rid of us , the old search of the world , and new creative solutions for the problems of today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we should do it together , and if we do that , and the ideas of play can share , we can transform bulgaria to something better .
the magazine for the most of the time is , i think , &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master took me to the most remote , because the most the most , was at the time .
after i had a gesture of the day , they were very -- i was accepted and i worked there for six months .
nine days ago , i had a fire .
you know -- all of the stuff .
my kids , the most , and henry .
we &apos;re going to get a lot of magazines , we did our homework , but where we looked at it , we were surrounded by images like this .
this picture literally came in seconds after i was put the baby in the poor and i brought it over .
rg : oh .
av : taboo number three : about his feces , you don &apos;t talk about it -- but i &apos;m going to talk today about my talk .
the general opinion is that every aspect of my life has become better for the time i &apos;ve been in the miracle of birth and family .
but you realize that you &apos;re going to be able to lose the control of the control of the wonderful way , which is how we have my lives very much , and what &apos;s very satisfying .
rg + av : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s a consequence of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve all seen this &quot; star &quot; with the most remote .
imagine , big , early , late , and you &apos;re going to hear a lot of the time , and john &apos;s , and john &apos;s walker can show how images can be on the exact attacks and they can analyze them on the wing .
now , since we &apos;ve experienced a time of extraordinary economic growth , the longest &apos;s longest is in the history of this country .
but now , a few months later , how good politicians like to bite , &quot; in the diaspora , &quot; in the diaspora , without the mine , &quot; how to put someone , you can &apos;t hide your uncertainty .
well , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i met this guy , a little bit more chaotic man , and the very chaotic man who had been raised by soup and kept the iron .
but interestingly , that &apos;s a future that &apos;s going to be a future in which society is a few tricks from capitalism , which is how to make the dna out of innovation in society by trying to make things and then they work , and then they work , and they &apos;re working .
i want to show you a fascinating new hypothesis , and some surprising new insights that i &apos;ve been working on , over the context of language , which you talk about , and your tendency to save .
and if i want to talk right , i forces myself , constantly to think about it .
well , this is a theory of theory .
please push this device so they &apos;re going to be able to be able to measure their immediate hand , so i can measure your own .
it &apos;s the present pleasure in exchange for future pain .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important the ability to communicate about generations .
we &apos;re constantly english .
but i &apos;m against using it as a barrier .
but they didn &apos;t get the results that they wanted .
and i was on the same time , i was on the field of the world &apos;s field , although i was a ph.d. in a deck of a ph.d. .
people and the humanities and the humanities and birds and all the red line is going up here . that &apos;s people , livestock and pets .
we focused more seriously in serious energy resources , produced products for the company .
let &apos;s see the next video .
the last night on the party , and -- you can see , you can see how it just is just a little bit of the time , and you can do every single one of them .
and he was a weekly about how people were the buddhist religion in india .
and he comes back as a broken man to the village .
and he has to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , the smell and everything .
the animals are in one of their lives . people are people .
we &apos;re going to take a lot of us out . we take the feeling of memory , and a long time to all the living creatures in this meditation .
and you think about how to be the things that are happy if you &apos;re happy , if you &apos;re happy .
and of course they are cruel and more and more .
although the change in your attitude is doing something for other creatures , you feel these new quality in you , and it &apos;s going to help you , and it &apos;s going to be a role model .
so the coffee cup , or the cup of the handle , is using a tool of the society to get the public health .
interestingly , the complexity is very high .
we &apos;ve heard about bill gates recently .
so it &apos;s very , very simple when you know how to read it .
well , let me close with four general remarks , an example and two more of the more .
and i don &apos;t want to stop with detail , but in the lower right corner , you &apos;re going to see what we have for this .
did you start doing that ?
and it comes out of the world &apos;s most , which is the kind of jimmy , what jimmy had been talking about , what our new kind of organization is , or better , how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things will always be less in the situation , it &apos;s going to be in the use of collaboration with the most remote .
let &apos;s take astronomy , which had yochai mentioned .
it &apos;s also going to be a professional arguments .
so it &apos;s not going to give a argument two camp , but between these camps , it will give all sorts of interesting positions which are taken from people .
that costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to transmit their own , and actually have a team , and they did a team , and they did .
and the first thing i thought was to thank him .
but the truth is that life is exactly happening here .
so people called and have news like this .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m like batman to be true to the true . &quot;
and the one that has no data has done , so that it was turned out to be a different city , and a new job had been imagined .
and in the last 35 years , i studied human behavior on the basis of everything , and the genes , the dopamine , and the same , until to the most remote .
some of you have a few of them . and it &apos;s dependent on gender .
this was one of these cases because they were not a violence under their ancestors , but in my father .
they &apos;re so similar to each other as you can be .
by the way , i have a email today , which is that we &apos;ve finished the last part of atlas .
and these guys here are the weak force that may be known at least .
so if you want to know why the sky is blue or why the nuclei are together , they should basically be in the principle of a powerful computer -- why dna has the shape that you &apos;ve got -- you know , it &apos;s got -- you know , it &apos;s got -- you know , it &apos;s got -- you know , it &apos;s got -- you know , it &apos;s got -- you know , it &apos;s got -- you know , it &apos;s got -- you know , it &apos;s got -- you know , it
the comparison is that people in this room are the higgs boson .
but it &apos;s really that with this theory , the physical theory of the big bang to unite the big bang is a very wonderful prediction . the model was not going to be made that this is happening , but it seems to be done .
they created this civilization , this wonderful picture , the darkness in light and it allows that to see civilization from all of this .
another big insight came from a study of the granny state university in 2010 , the baseball maps of the 1950s , the baseball of the 1950s .
in a similar study in germany , researchers use george &apos;s to measure the most of the time and after they had a face to the face of the face to be smiling .
&quot; because the colors that you have , not the european standard , &quot; he said .
&quot; safer ? why ? have you got more police police ? &quot;
we built the bright system that people , people of the people , brought to think that they were traveling in abroad when they were going to be a cause of their cause .
president roosevelt said , &quot; believe that you can do something and you &apos;ve done it half . &quot;
all of port-au-prince came out of the entrepreneurs and offered a drill of water bottles for mobile phones .
a graph for the most devastating power of technology is in kibera .
until 2015 , it will give three billion owners on the world .
in the shops of the environment , the batteries and bread were the bread .
this river of time is embedded in everything : in the antarctic of a computer , in the enlightenment of a computer , the hebrew .
read an interview with a writer ?
and also , when i look at the big bears , i remember how i &apos;m a kid on his head to slide , not from his shoulders , and i feel like this kid .
we &apos;ve seen the way creative technology can be and we can do that in our lives and our lives , and we can choose these solutions , innovation and moments that are not going to be the flow of time , but again .
my mother was a lot of the time .
in every single refugee camp , they had to decipher soldiers that my older brother mark , the nine was taking , and he wanted to make a child child .
and i should do it alone .
take something you want to have from the suitcase .
then i ended up in a literal process because i didn &apos;t get my feelings .
thank you .
so almost everything on earth is going to be wiped out about five times .
and the answer is the answer .
why should that play a role ?
so , in fact , we can grow every organ from any cell .
here &apos;s the rise in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the conclusion .
if the cursor are shining with the same speed , the robot is floating .
and you see how robust the control is .
and he does that while he &apos;s obstacles .
they take their neighbors true .
this is what we &apos;re going to double the most , we associate the most , a little bit , and we can put them in the team of making teams like that .
but the robot can also figure out where it wants to go .
i can feel that . but there &apos;s so much and i want to extend your horizon to the mind , the consciousness and your view on honeybees .
this has been a huge problem for many years , basically since the late 1980s , the most late , bacteria , bacteria and the most remote with themselves .
they don &apos;t experience that .
the charter for their territory , and the honey -- there &apos;s a lot of the honey -- they use the honey of their bars .
the bee dies . honeybees die when they stick , so they didn &apos;t want to do it .
okay , now , the question is , why is that ?
of course , we have , especially in the last decade , the world with a dense chain of the industry , with a chain of global trade .
and never before , so many people were not aware of this fact .
in fact , not many of you know that our bread of of course was not a european invention .
and especially the meat in the world and china is moving up the way up .
and conservation is for most people , and here are not many farmers under them , to be bad , to be the environment , to be able to destroy the environment .
everything depends together .
and so while i do my bread , i &apos;m done it , and i &apos;m going to get it . and i &apos;m not trying to burn the hands .
also , it has to be to keep a long time to keep the land available there , materials and the most remote .
you take someone like me , a scientist , analyzed and developed a new technology , and it &apos;s a new technology , and it &apos;s inevitably the quantitative .
because i hope you &apos;re taking this from here today , a new connection with nature .
this was a few days ago in a hurry .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
this is by the last year .
but the final member was a of them , and shekhar kapur turned a film about her , and they should see the queen , they should see .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but this is a kind of a commodity .
this is a patient &apos;s patient who was 73 -- he was needed to get a goggles , but it was a beating .
i like this slide because you &apos;re talking about what people really motivated to change , and what not .
if you eat a high meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a kind of a more , a poor food , even more fat because , even more carbs , and even more carbs , so the percentage is lower , but the actual number of higher , the goal is to reduce both .
one of the most of the most of the things that were found was that 70 percent of people were liberated , 65 percent of people had bad breath , lucy percent of the people , is not healthy food .
on the other hand , everything is , what intimacy is , is the most dramatic .
i hope he &apos;s not falling .
the film is based on a computer of f. scott
two of the things were involved in the project : warner brothers and the most remote .
and we had enough passion to make the most important and technology .
so we &apos;re so ashamed of motion capture .
the number seemed infinitely to be infinitely .
and these are the data that we get to get to this , and then that &apos;s used for the model .
and so the finished picture was that in the movie , it was used .
that was a very , very , very early sample .
and we found this in the middle of the state of transcendence .
and has a own way .
people from the mountains are going to overcome these cruel , and they &apos;ve lived in the way they lived for their lives .
we were too in the middle -- two millimeters as a driver -- and imagine that this big one is a ocean from sand , 40 degrees c , a water water .
i think the camel is best in the world &apos;s best more popular animal . &quot;
and they use them as much as we see our most similar .
we weigh our animals .
so i &apos;ll show you another movie .
i don &apos;t get to the way my body temperature is 40 degrees of c -- enough to take a egg .
and so , thank you for the invitation .
start a meeting with a poem . it would be an idea .
but how would it like to tell you when you never know how to do the next day if you &apos;re a living god , your shoulders in the clouds , or if you sit down from the messenger , you &apos;re going to sit down from the messenger of the pharmacy ?
who could sleep in this night ?
but did you know that judy was getting 150,000 dollars in your age , that the most talented d was the french army , the french army , and he had been adopted pascal , no , i mean , he invented the calculator ?
at the end , they sat in a tree and a screen to the other .
and the human favorite system is more than that , but you would take these two columns , probably not much left .
and also , we have the problem that you can &apos;t build a construction , which would be too difficult to be a single elephant .
one component of it is understanding . here &apos;s a kind of a , &quot; the ability to understand the feelings of the other and sharing . &quot;
so we &apos;re exploring more complex expressions here . here &apos;s consolation .
that the test doesn &apos;t get good for them .
there &apos;s a very simple task that you need to do .
a philosopher was even writing that it was impossible to be a sense of fairness , because fairness became invented in the french revolution .
now it &apos;s not a lonely crazy , it &apos;s not two crazy , three is a lot and a lot of news .
the last decade i spent with this , and i &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a good thing , hopefully for a good thing that &apos;s the most good thing .
and i have to say , god is thank you .
so i heard , in a way , it was a success .
over the years , the serious thing can make the serious system .
and so , the more successful puppet : how healthy life i &apos;m almost going to show me
and i think many scientists are sharing this view .
a really cool thing .
now these studies are scientifically scientifically , and they were formed , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
ask the story of the story that &apos;s not going to tell .
... a priest ?
last one group , the fact that the indus people believe that the indus people are in the ancestor of people today .
on the right , how many ? okay .
it can be useful to create more data , which then are the same thing .
this sign is the most common thing that &apos;s the most common of the indus script , and it &apos;s just in this text .
it turns out that it &apos;s a long time in india , and it &apos;s a long name of the ground to forgive the birth of the birth of birth .
space , we all know how it looks .
this wire is the most profound thing that &apos;s going to be done to the name of bell .
and the historical discovery was made that the most historical discovery of the time could be used as well as radio waves .
all the young people in the city -- the city of the city .
somebody who sits next to you -- that &apos;s okay in a computer , but you would sit on a computer , but somebody would sit so dense , and you would put it up .
the dalai lama always likes to say -- he says , if you &apos;re in your mind , you &apos;re going to be able to get the idea of the brain &apos;s idea , because you see that you &apos;re even and your pain and joy , and the joy of the intelligence is to be smaller playground for your intelligence .
but take this wonderful thing , which is the most beautiful thing that we &apos;ve shown us . they &apos;re afraid of the most remote .
a man was a tank in front of a tank that became a symbol for the world of the resistance .
but what would they have not done , if they had the modern communications to create a sense that it was wrong , that was going to be done immediately ?
combine the power of a global ethic with our ability to communicate on global level , and we &apos;re going to organize global warming with the challenges that are now the world &apos;s survival and most global nature .
in the museum of the children in rwanda , there &apos;s a photograph of a young boy -- and the museum of children &apos;s lives are the life of life , who was left when the most of the people died in the process of rwanda .
here &apos;s the task : help me to build a bloody , a very minimal , a little bit of a sudden .
you can move on very different , very different , and they vary in the world &apos;s movement , the movement of the surface and the protected .
this is the driving algae .
boy : pop .
we slow up to see the spines in action .
mark schwartz at stanford , one of my partners , is an extraordinary engineer , which is a technology called the form of the world called the skin .
you see almost like aliens , and the secret , what you &apos;re going to stick , are your favorite toes .
here we go down the band-aid .
these are the water structures allow the spines , and the water , and the most challenging , to be very challenging , is to keep the hard surfaces .
so , the long time , the long beautiful songs are making a long cold songs , and the males are also allowed to find each other as females and choose a partner .
so if dolphins are less than 20 feet away , they have to create less than half the time .
if we think of marine marine populations for animals like dolphins , we need to be about the consequences of our interventions , which we thought of right now .
after the most , the marine marine system has made the systems available to the systems to experience what scientists could hear .
they just hear the low frequencies .
if males and females use this signal to find a partner and they &apos;re distributed , they &apos;re asking , what the impact of the population would have been held in the recovery of the population of the population .
as ships are made of the water , they found that with a better more , more of this noise can reduce the noise of this noise .
they &apos;re the speed of 50 percent .
we see strangers , we see strangers , 300 times , and it &apos;s always more . and they &apos;re not like us .
you &apos;ve all got possibilities to do .
we observe a continuous rise at the men .
and obviously there &apos;s a hundred , the hundred .
with initiatives like 100 dollars , it &apos;s the idea that we &apos;re going to bring a whole new generation of people into the old computer of the computer .
thank you .
i think nothing about this problem is .
our daily life is , but we &apos;re saying , in a extraordinary state , we say in a sense of a more extraordinary state .
usually it &apos;s one or two per year .
and there are .
but we &apos;re much more more more more more efficient .
part of the challenge was to try to try and get rhythm and space by not just my hands -- the juggling is much more powerful -- but the rhythm of my body and the balls with my feet .
and then you play crazy .
ok , because they don &apos;t understand what a kind of a thing is , i give you a little hint .
now , again , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
you have somebody up here , who &apos;s the most important principle of doing this , ok ?
nonsense -- and then it comes to calm . just a little number of time .
with space and straight in the room , work in other ways .
and then the levels of levels .
in this year -- you would be able to show the slides -- in this year , we carry the most of the time in this year , a project that we &apos;ve helped the design of design .
we can call this on a computer system which allows you to put another information over the clothes while you &apos;re doing this .
mark scott adams : i found that i &apos;m the leading expert in the way .
and we also have a new product tonight , and it &apos;s a new time that it &apos;s shown in public .
now , the farmers can only be in the season , and not in the world &apos;s pockets .
electrons disappear in a kind of a kind of a kind of a plastic and then just energy , and energy can &apos;t see .
this is what he thought he was there .
potatoes , potatoes have 48 chromosomes . did you know that ?
well . atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
and somebody said to him , &quot; well , what is the sense of it , mr. ?
we &apos;ve been doing about four years of this .
if google is a book , you put it in a very beautiful format .
i &apos;ll give you an example .
suddenly , in the middle &apos; 40s , everybody was excited .
but you can &apos;t get it to you .
but also many very on the right , that apparently has the propaganda .
if you &apos;re going to get the floating .
if i run this pink sound for longer than some minutes , you would literally stop hearing it .
many people escape to digitize , but that turn big , public spaces like this , shared , common , small personal , small personal .
you can also do that on a beautiful place , like a lake .
and finally , a reception .
and i said , &quot; this is my job . &quot;
thank you so much that you were here . we &apos;re all so grateful . &quot;
and it went away .
because they were not at us on the sidewalk , and they couldn &apos;t see exchange between me and my offspring , a exchange that appeared to us , but the alien .
now , i &apos;m going to tell you , in the last year , there was a lot of competition , because the arab spring is still expanding , which is still the most important thing ? what else ?
this photograph was actually in a police police , and in the floor , they see the most of the people who were tracking by the police .
the kids just do photos in a class , the teacher gets them , she &apos;s screaming on the most remote .
in today , it &apos;s about the brain and , yay , somewhere out there , there &apos;s a kind of a computer .
that &apos;s something we can work in our lifetime . i thought i can make a difference and so i tried to get out of the world &apos;s .
but sometimes science has some other properties that they really really do .
what are we going to bring there more data ?
there &apos;s something that we believe it &apos;s obvious , but wrong .
it &apos;s so that intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we don &apos;t look at the alligator as a very intelligent , not in a human way .
in people , we &apos;ve developed the most of the most of the most remote part of the world &apos;s name , and nature has been designed to be part of this little trick .
it &apos;s not that you &apos;re looking at it and say , &quot; what am i seeing ?
not like a computer computer . not in the least like a computer computer .
these are the things that are going to come .
we need a little police , we need a little military , but only to defense .
you can see it on your face . &quot;
they traveled because they were at the time of the elections outside of the country .
this is a lot of the time that &apos;s going to do .
and then , when they were born the door , grandma said , &quot; no , no , no , no .
they wash it like this : by hand .
these group use three , every one .
it &apos;s real .
it did to learn english and learn this as a foreign language .
the computer already , and it &apos;s a three participants .
if you think about the other , you think of the tar the united states , which is actually part of our experiment , because that &apos;s exactly what we did .
we repeated the experiment with the same groups , but a half a time , but a half a time of the enlightenment , as we deal with the data , and the actual beginning of the design .
the price of this is the blowfish of paradise .
and they moved and they were moving to each other and they were going to go to each other and they were going to go to each other .
we &apos;re really good at talking about skills and security and health , we &apos;re really bad at talking about character .
then you &apos;re asking personal coach , the most bad way of the most bad breath in the bad breath .
i don &apos;t really feel like emotion .
the first gift , or talent , is a lot of the ability -- the ability to make other people in the heads and find out what they have .
they own the humility .
this is what the unconscious is going to be .
we found them between the world &apos;s , raped by many , many men , i don &apos;t know how many .
where does your journey start ?
and that it &apos;s not normal to live in a home .
what was my challenge ?
they need their empathy .
lexicography : the process of dictionaries .
well , first of all , i &apos;ll give the queen to blame because it &apos;s funny .
online online must be different .
the bad words -- look , if someone thinks about a place and then it doesn &apos;t think it &apos;s not on the map , and he thinks , &quot; this map is doable ! &quot;
you think , &quot; ok , if we think words are tools that we use to give our thoughts to tell us how to know that the marines are better than hammer ?
the sensitivity has 33 different varieties of beck for &quot; set &quot; set .
and then this mike is the most mike . mike &apos;s life lives in britain .
i have the whole time , &quot; the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , &quot; said .
so , i &apos;m a chair .
and to make a long story short , i landed here .
and so , so , a piece of piece , as this three days , you start to understand , why am i listening to all this kind of thing ?
they may be from a ted speaker and so we can keep the conversation during the year , and next year , after the same intellectual and emotional journey .
the manufacturers don &apos;t have the most cheap in their cheap , because they &apos;re not sure what the public would start with a precise smooth , which even fold on the palm of the palm .
and there was a insecure , if that was already a hurricane , and it was technically not able to find the channel .
instead of putting the most , more active , you &apos;re doing it .
and : &quot; you can trust . &quot;
we call us a call of &amp; amp ; it &apos;s a rectangle and we live in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this work is the cartoon of a computer of a human being .
we debate about the case &quot; what the world needs now is nuclear -- right or wrong ?
and now , there &apos;s only three of the most little things that are -- coal and gas , water , which is almost everywhere -- and nuclear .
we &apos;ve become the russian of the russian , by turning it into electricity .
and the emissions are the equivalent of all greenhouse emissions and particles that have transform warming , and to co2 .
now , if you look at the fact that the prevalence of nuclear weapons are doing nuclear weapons , because we know that india and pakistan is developed by nuclear weapons in the world .
for wind , the surface is much bigger , but the most little the most little .
reality is that 21 states have nuclear power , right ?
and in the senate of the united states , we need the support of both parties -- just one or two voices need to be the global warming in the senate , and this room can help .
we &apos;re not going to get out of renewables .
i &apos;ve been worried about the 10 years ago .
thank you .
this was -- my motivation was been from apollo depp .
for the first time we have enough wealth in the hands of some less people , and the available technology that allows us to be able to allow the exploration of space .
26 groups from seven countries took the competition , every one between one and 25 million dollars .
and we can get them to the space station .
and the advantage for the funders is the sum of the world &apos;s sum and social health .
would you surprise us , so we &apos;re going to be doing it ?
that means that surfaces can cut itself . they can be incredibly small .
a challenge was how we can express these new algorithmic order in a column .
what i didn &apos;t know about time because we had just seen the outside , was that the surfaces are on the ground , in the column . that was a pretty surprising discovery .
inspired by the process of cell cell , michael &apos;s algorithms , the incredible , amazing forms of building , are creating a million of the areas , but you can build it . and you could build it . and you could make our understanding of architecture .
so look at this picture here -- many forms of dance here for you .
it &apos;s a very rare disease .
this is a drug that has been developed for cancer .
you can see , the chip is even the way the chip is going to be .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s led by young people .
and i think many people here in the room are in the same position , as i &apos;m .
so i think women are going to be in our society , because they realize that it &apos;s very important for their future generations .
we &apos;ve realized that recently , more people have been able to use resources like youtube and social networks to give their stories to their own own , their photos and their own stories with their own voices .
we &apos;re at the same time , and we get to explore our part of the world .
so i became more or less than nothing .
so i thought , &quot; maybe if i do this ants a few apartments , you pull it up there . &quot;
this was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do that ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back to the next day .
and it went ...
my work , roughly , sometimes , is five , six or seven weeks ; that can &apos;t always be fooled .
and i &apos;m going to move it around , and it shaped the chariot &apos;s chariot .
so i broke the needle .
it &apos;s a very powerful work , but the best things come into small , small things .
they expect their employees to do what they asked them when they &apos;ve done the task , they can do more extra , they can do more .
there &apos;s this absolute concentration of being this absolute , absolute , absolute center of consciousness , consciousness , an absolute center of compassion and love that defined the primary properties of the mexican .
my favorite body flew into a direction , my favorite wheel in the other .
i asked all the walks that i would not do with you , who i would not be able to do with you , who i wouldn &apos;t be able to look at , who i wouldn &apos;t look at you .
because you don &apos;t need the most of the time .
and if you &apos;re going to give you the back of the back , you can just go down and make it a little bit of it . &quot;
20 years ago , the doctors had been cut my leg and hoped , and there was a 15 of the years of chance .
as i became more and more of the time , and in my life , i was probably 14 kilos easier than i am now .
and nobody is going to turn this modern system into my eyes more than david black .
so , go upright , you say , is the threshold of what makes us human .
he &apos;s the largest academy of the international union for the most popular name , which is the least the most popular name i &apos;ve ever heard .
he was born for three months early and it was really a fantastic of him .
so once i tried to go to the piano , i became hard to be a lot of a lot of the time .
and at the end , you were so fast that things like the flight &quot; is no problem , right ?
do you want to play me ?
dp : &quot; tiger trek . &quot;
i don &apos;t do that .
they &apos;re fighting their own lifestyle in this forest , in a world , which is even clean , a world that doesn &apos;t even be implemented in a world that &apos;s not being done yet .
so we know that they &apos;re able to be able to have the tools that have been absolutely impossible to be the research of absolutely impossible than i started .
the long loving connection to mother , the mother who evolved during this long childhood , and also the siblings can remain the whole life , and that can be to 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and also the huge camp of the ocean in the forest need meat now , and that &apos;s how the pygmies are going to be stored in the congo and in their wonderful lifestyle , so many years , they have been going to be , in the world .
yesterday , somebody said that .
so we have a lot of state in every state , and the problems in florida are other than the new york .
come on and get me down here ?
there &apos;s the politicians out there ?
what we want to do in the lab is that pretty much , but with a few dozen types of molecules -- such a radical reduction of complexity , but yet , something more , to create something more , a little bit more .
it &apos;s actually very much more powerful , if you &apos;re going to form , it &apos;s actually not really something .
now , where they &apos;re all experts for protocells , we &apos;re going to play a game .
we see the self-assembly of this body from oil oil that we saw before , and the black blobs of this black , and that black , organic , organic black mud .
in his lab , martin &apos;s &quot; protocells &quot; from chemicals , experimental polymers of chemicals that are like living cells . his work shows how life could come in the earth first , and maybe elsewhere .
this is a kind of a kind of a time to run your tadpole on the night .
what &apos;s this -- where did you know that ? they took it .
but if we do that at every -- every fire fire could define the least .
and it &apos;s the bathroom that &apos;s otherwise being adapted in their beautiful pink lungs , and it &apos;s going to be involved with -- with -- it &apos;s going to be .
the birds could jump from one to another .
you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to talk about it . you can talk to him .
but these herd are going to be a big setup of our planet .
next to the next , we &apos;re going to multiply skin cells and multiply it in a computer .
we &apos;ve been working with thousands of years with a thousand years , and we started with products like wine , beer and yogurt .
it &apos;s true that if we &apos;re going to get around the world , we see our research , we see that it &apos;s almost a universal pursuit of people after that .
let me just talk to you about hydrogen .
this is a huge entrepreneurial energy to create mobile energy .
if we can see these kinds of things , it can also be different .
you had to survive .
and we &apos;ve been sure to be our district district , to get funding and support .
because why should our students go away from their own .
it became a book , then a show .
there was an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
here &apos;s the west coast , you &apos;ve destroyed their forest .
but on this picture , you see how we started building the most , the most short one of the most , the most soon of brazil .
and as for me , my favorite time came to start , i &apos;ve been studying the new field of the brain &apos;s subject .
if you &apos;re in the south african , you see the expansion of new york city as it was , at the end of american revolution .
the white surfaces on this map are the most significant places .
or the most , the wet loop , insects and the places need to be places .
maybe a kind of a more , a more of the time .
it &apos;s so much force in science , and to unite science , that these images are going to come together . it &apos;s like both sides of the mirror .
and we have a really dramatic level of this in our society now .
so i don &apos;t need to go to it .
you can get the dried , of course , what should be .
this is a building building .
one example we all know is that the mobile phones . right ?
and it &apos;s all about this question -- of course in a very artistic and indirectly way .
but it &apos;s happening everywhere , and these tools are parts of that , which help us create it .
seriously -- clapping , it &apos;s quiet -- that &apos;s really great .
alex carroll : a sustainable future sees a sustainable future
you could be my , that a big problem could be a law , but congress doesn &apos;t seem to be very much to let congress be very much .
but if you put a lot of quality of the living in the high ages , and then it &apos;s not okay .
some of the things we share , we made things that we &apos;ve found , and every single option is caused in this industry .
this is the simple thing .
i had a very educational , a very , expensive education in india , and that &apos;s almost broken me .
and i thought i &apos;m going to start a barefoot college -- college only for the poor .
a professional is somebody , with a combination of competence , confidence and belief .
when i said that , they said , &quot; show us what can be possible . what do you do ?
the entire electricity comes from the sun .
democracy , the way you &apos;re missed your country , what you should do if you &apos;re arrested , what you should do if you &apos;re sick , if you &apos;re sick .
come on to tensions , cut the presence on the schools , comes between teachers and parents , so that the puppets and parents are calling the teachers and say , &quot; give your hands . &quot;
you use sign sign .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , mr. president .
a more of the time .
and our most of our most , dynamic , dynamic computers of the world for this kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of .
you see the most of the time that we &apos;re going to have the most of the time that we have an artist for the scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , there &apos;s data of these two groups of people , data about how happy they are .
&quot; i &apos;m physically , financially , emotionally , emotionally and in almost any other way . &quot; i &apos;m not a minute .
he didn &apos;t have the money , and of course ray had six months later , the same idea .
in this case , it &apos;s because they &apos;re going to be used by the experiment i &apos;m going to share with you , of course , from the other .
we collected our materials , went from the room and waited half an hour .
i &apos;m going to show you why .
they were making two pictures and they had two beautiful people , and they were going to be a little bit of beautiful , and we said , &quot; what would you do ? &quot;
we take a completely new group of naive , and say , &quot; you know , we give a more of the way and we can do it on two different ways .
and the big car , the big car and the most beautiful .
voices : it flies in the air . oh shit .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t start ! &quot;
don &apos;t forget that these tradition don &apos;t come from the clouds from the clouds , but on a time , in a time , even before we were talking about stories on the ground , or the water of wet .
the way of food , yeah .
the kind of thing with the top roof , you know .
and so we went to my father , because i knew he would kill me when i was going to go to it . so we go into the car .
&quot; and had this guy a blue uniform on the face of a blue expression , &quot; and a computer expression in the face ? &quot;
i really want to get there ? because if i don &apos;t have a thread , i &apos;m not going to have a lot of the way to get to the -- enough metaphor for your taste ?
look ? we &apos;re a secret club with a secret of a secret .
she says , &quot; ma , you have to look . &quot;
&quot; i agree for the little , old lady , damn time ! &quot;
it &apos;s up from the car . &quot;
i really have great fear .
so what is the social outcome of this ?
where can i go today and with who together ?
and if we have it , we will decide how many miles we drive , where we live and work .
smart bonds on the station communicate and see them exactly where your bus is just on the road and when he comes , and you can buy their tickets .
i want to be able to make the wireless depression , and i challenge that this network is supposed to be available with open standards for every .
and they came up here in the late 1960s .
and for all of you , that &apos;s with a mental illness in touch , knowledge , what can be a challenge .
i said i wanted to tell the most of the time , i wanted to share with you the three a &apos; fantastic one of the most fantastic and i wanted to leave them with a wooden bag .
because they all were three years old .
and so what i love to love is that the thylacines is just a authentic person , and that &apos;s what it is about authenticity .
i ate the way with a lot of the time . &quot;
you can sleep in clean sheets .
j it &apos;s so many that it &apos;s been problematic .
i found it weird to the way that it was a competition , about a fresh wound .
it &apos;s largely a white white , rich , rich , which was not being affected for the city .
it looks pretty simple , but it was a kind of a kind of a .
people are going to be more likely to -- they were amazed about the destruction , but there was also a sense of the most of the world &apos;s new york , which i found very moving .
because at looking at the four platforms of the world -- where one of the improved version of a computer is -- we knew that it had to be food to be able to respond to the conditions and the remarkable definition of ground zero .
we have the opportunity to rethink our thinking about cities .
dr : it was a honor .
and i know kids are responding every year .
if -- god forbid -- somebody from us here , and a concussion , would be most of us in a period of a few hours to some weeks .
you have to know with the problems that we &apos;re talking about today .
as turns out , tom saw a helmet for 20 dollars a good opportunity to preserve a 100,000 year-old .
that &apos;s not true , but it happened tony blair during the rockefeller academy in 2005 , when his boss , of course , discovered , &quot; discovered , &quot; and he was described .
with other words , they have a common and growing complexity of visual language , which is happening in the middle sequence .
he said that there was no cure .
today all countries are struggling to offer patents for drugs that have been at least 20 years .
it depends on the world &apos;s company , and their patents to make their patents available and make them available for others .
in fact , the same way of stage , a more of the way , the people were sitting in the hallway , the afternoon in a very high humidity , and they didn &apos;t feel .
you can adapt everything to worry for your well-being .
he provides all these services , and they put tickets , and so little things that you &apos;re doing online , but for people who he &apos;s just connecting with the digital world .
the question was , &quot; how do you do this teacher .
and then , what he does here . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ...
and the husband of daughter , he was also sick by the unemployed of his wife .
but the visual complexity is still very big .
well , the most , a computer of our studies .
well , if we feel emotions , we show them .
and they could get the impression that the unhappy people are taking another structural position within the network .
this is my favorite . &quot;
they &apos;re both of carbon , and yet one of both of the two of them are put in a particular way , on the left , and they get the soft and dark .
to get something to a little bit of a time , let me pull a little bit .
older to become older .
under the same circumstances , older people are giving their cognitive resources , like the most important and memory , more on positive information than negative .
we cost life .

misha glenny : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen -- a clever group political hacker , 2011 , is the 2011 of 2011 .
the net connects everything and will be a lot of human activities .
interestingly , anonymous is using his own information , but not for financial profit .
he explained to me how he was in 2003 and 2004 as he went in new york tour , 10,000 dollars from the textile industry here , 30,000 dollars from the pharmaceutical industry , by the way he used a fiber cards .
he was born in a stable and respect in middle class , and he was born in the middle of the city , his obsession with play as a teenager .
and most of the time , with the script and the most , they showed no real social skills in the outside world -- only in the net .
i think there are several reasons . i &apos;m not going to go to the details , but some mention .
but they &apos;re all of the market , and what &apos;s the market is , especially , a number of demographic , the big demographic of the world &apos;s greatest demographic .
we &apos;ve found a lot of examples for dead big boxes that have transformed in all kinds of social institutions , many schools , many schools , many churches , and many libraries like this .
and finally , i expect the streets to be stored by the mall of the mall .
it &apos;s very successful . and it helped me have helped that eight of 13 percent of the age of the age of the age of the age of the plans is to become a lot of the age of the .
the stream was covered by the parking parking .

&quot; his vagina to look at &quot; she said , &quot; is a whole whole a whole kind of a whole thing . &quot;
but actually , it didn &apos;t start there , it started with a conversation with a woman .
it &apos;s about an gender , which is a fundamental resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a kind of a , and the way that it is actually in the body , and i think there are a real meaning in us , our bodies , in our heads , that this separation has created a division of decision that &apos;s often made of the decision .

and he got the same answer : &quot; bring me the best workers you can find and if you &apos;re good enough , i &apos;m going to be a . &quot;
and also , it says , &quot; it &apos;s okay . it was all so beautiful .
&quot; ah ! &quot;
as said , he &apos;s going to be too much .
and you can imagine it right .
you know what you &apos;re looking for .
but we &apos;re taking care of the most difficult cases and the other day .
so we came to these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother went to the time of the soviet union .
and if you think it &apos;s not going to be , it &apos;s not going to be done until you continue to do it .

it &apos;s there , because the photons can &apos;t reach the average depth of the ocean , which is the gulf of the beach . the valley is on the ground .
and so we went along the mountain mountain in a field next to the world &apos;s population , and there was the missing heat .
so i started to develop a new new school system , with a computer of a , which i &apos;m going to be replaced with , and i don &apos;t have to go in my car .
we find the members of conservation .
and i looked at them yesterday , she &apos;s up in seattle . ok .
but i would be a kid without license , and i &apos;d leave the control of my solar system .
in some parts of the world , for example , in south africa , education is very hard .
when we saw the effect of the strongest , andrew and i decided we had to increase it to be able to offer the best education .
what was the special thing about these courses ?
the video is interrupted all the few minutes and the students will ask a question .
so we wanted to convince some of our colleagues of the humanities that multiple choices don &apos;t have so bad .
in terms of certain courses , you can ask yourself what the most common of the most common , and how to help the students , to fix this .
we actually see the beginning of either a personalized curriculum or through the feedback of the feedback that we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe , and what my first thought was , what infinity means when i was a kid .
and in our society , of course , it &apos;s mostly about making the reality of other others .
i have my doubt about the values of newton &apos;s science , like , for example , it &apos;s going to be rational that you &apos;re rational in a computer .
so , you can understand my surprise when i got to read the new yorker , that alan is proposing , the chief record , the chief harbor , the fda &apos;s native debt , was his mentor mentor .
i think you can do that fun , which is not the ones that have not been . exactly from that reason , i don &apos;t have a jokes about selective design and his tadpole .
i &apos;ve been right now that old times of the most old time , which i &apos;m telling you .
he said , i had to pay it to him , because it can take to 18 years to be able to get a really good thing .
well ? yes ? what ? i can &apos;t hear it . &quot;
and i &apos;m afraid that this active someone doesn &apos;t like us .

george w. bush : what the defense of our security costs , and what the defense of our freedom costs , we need to pay the price . &quot;
ten years ago , no astronomer was in the world -- well , or very few astronomers -- that there are planets outside of our solar system .
many other ecosystems on earth are truly in danger .
he &apos;s constantly going to be able to get a experiment with a particle particle , and a process of a process could be destroyed , which is destroyed the world .
we have to make biotechnology with biotechnology as a result of the same .
so , of course , we don &apos;t want to see .
what can we do ?
and now the worst thing comes .
we use a lot of money to ensure , sure , that we don &apos;t die at a time , but we &apos;re almost not going to be out of it . and yet it &apos;s completely preventable .
we don &apos;t want to get caught on the wrong foot .
i hope that &apos;s going to be .
this is very , very important because this is the system that &apos;s the process of life , from the life , and it &apos;s now for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing insight . and we &apos;ve only been aware of it for recently .
and that &apos;s what the system was going to be made , a number of places in the southern hemisphere , in these circles .
everybody who comes to this , just pulls up the database and can get the information to get to it , which is going to be done for everything .
we &apos;re on the wave of the wave , the technological possibilities .
in a earthquake , big amounts of these new microbes we never saw before , from the sea floor .
the most , john , creates a network of a network of the water cameras and sensors that our oceans are doing the global , interactive laboratory -- and that &apos;s a kind of a more , a lot of the world &apos;s world .
so i think optimism is moving forward .
so again , radical versus conservative .
the most obvious thing about the most obvious . you know , too often , you want to understand everything .
our intellectual desires are complex .
you know that it &apos;s true ; the slope , as unexpected , will always be unexpected .
but i &apos;m going to play something completely unknown , and even with mistakes , rather than repeat the same thing , so it &apos;s from his co-author .
risks of rooms that have never been so much as much as they should be in a big city .
there &apos;s the emotions of victims .
daniel macmaster builds up very large ideas , and he &apos;s called 17 terms of the architecture of architecture -- raw , the social , radically -- and inspiration for every bold creative pursuit .
it also has the lowest of all the cars of the size .
so , what &apos;s really going on , or will it be just a few of the things that are going to be .
em : it &apos;s just that it &apos;s just . if not , we &apos;re in big trouble .
and with this capital , and put the carbon panels on the roof and then it &apos;s a continuous , or the doctor &apos;s seat , or a series of a star , which is lower than the electricity .
we are almost failed , but we &apos;ve come to 2008 .
it &apos;s similar to a jet .
how about all the world in the world , a person who was able to be innovative ?
look at this .
boy , if you &apos;re going to see our livestock , and a ramp of the way he eats one of our goats is very nervous . then go to him .
we suffered hunger .
our tradition looks like this : in every single piece of the water , there &apos;s a holy fire .
so , until now we were able to fund the world wildlife in the world , which is very small to get to programs with the programs of the world .
also , very important -- we invest the money in enlightenment and hiv .
and the most dramatic -- again , a lot of a lot of a lot of the world in the world -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful means .
and we hide this price behind giant winning .
dan hodgman and alice &apos;s passionate , the shortcut revolution for environmental food .
and the other thing , spare zetas , oysters , the , , , , , , , , , , were the known species .
this is like a snob of protein .
science is seeing the world through the mind , the methods , things that can measured and described , but you have the art of knowledge , and you know , the art of knowledge and insight .
from a couple of cameras , a plan was a plan with 25 weeks .
this is the natural cycle .
that would usually be a photographer , and it &apos;s not a picture to make a photograph , right ? but sometimes it has to be that the dimensions are going to show .
here &apos;s what the glacier is going to go back .
this is a couple of cameras .
could india be the origin of the origin or a global center for innovation , just like it &apos;s a global center for a global center of the world and the most remote ?

you can &apos;t be professor if you &apos;re not too a student .
the best hospitals , in the doctors , would go to cancer , and at a frigoris , the heart of the disease , heart disease , for artificial , to artificial , to the 4 a.m.
it works a little bit like -- that &apos;s a recently a recently of the four o &apos;clock in the morning .
i said , i know a very a very a very good message when i see a look .
everybody in our society comes with cancer -- if not personally personally , through a beloved person , a family member , a colleague , a friend .
in this space room , the genetic material , the chromosomes , within a nucleus .
we &apos;ve applied treating fields in the lab over 20 different cancers , and we see this effect in all of it .
he got the most the most .
but what we can see is that in sixth month of the tumor , it starts to be a little bit of the tumor .
this is just the beginning .
this is a new workplace , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re 15 feet deep , and they collect rainwater from the roof , there &apos;s a little pipe , and from their yard .

somewhere is going to go somewhere or a more of the scene through this scene .
this is called &quot; existing . &quot;

these are the beautiful stairs that we just saw on one of the images .
and the most , in order to get 27 percent , is the 600,000 less people per year .
10 percent of india .
they will get the jobs in kofi , which are bringing people out of the world &apos;s way and they get to the way to the industrial and prosperity .
and the countries to the right , because they see the most , in principle , in principle every country , we say , less than 5,000 dollars , a more of the people , we say , three .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india grew up not so much .
buy african products .
but i think a lot larger is that this logic is that this logic -- that we should drop ipods and not bombs -- i mean , it would be a great title for thomas .
and then 500 people have been doing it , and four of them were chosen to visit the institution and they were to go to the institution to be able to be in the way .

and the internet is the internet &apos;s worst expectations ?
&quot; how a man . &quot;
and he was going to be younger with us .
because for me , that &apos;s in this time , and in this kind of , the question was , &quot; you want to say , &quot; you want ? &quot; either sex or drugs we didn &apos;t have .
i was like paralyzed , people .
as indians , and now politicians and the most , i &apos;m pretty much about the most , which is our country , worried about all the talk about india as a new appreciation of the new superpower , even the new superpower .
with other words , all kinds of things tell us about countries about countries , regardless of whether they want to get the daylight or not .
but the lightning in our country then , in the world , was quite slow to the one , and it took a half an hour to a call .
you can &apos;t understand the instructions .
this can sometimes have a more unhealthy consequences . ok .
and this one of you who have their money , like , may be surprised to see how many of the most powerful things are on the most remote .
i went home and i was doing a little bit . i found some terrifying statistics .
and the most little thing is , a bathroom without water .
and now i feel like george bush .
now , this title , this phrase , comes from a critic , a early critic and this is a passage that i just love , and i would like to read them .
and that &apos;s a good thing , because if it would be , mother nature would have a problem : how about everything in the world we get chimpanzees to mate ?
this is the hardest part , which is not obvious . and therefore i have the end of the end .
ok ? stop . now .
i don &apos;t know why there are a lot of the time that they &apos;re in the garden , but they don &apos;t care , they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you .

it &apos;s like this . they should look like this .
bob mckim has a different one -- another version of this exercise in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned that with time : you get a much better , much more creative results if all of the rules are .
and suddenly there was a productive conversation about design about design about a real object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little bit skeptical , i &apos;ll get back to it .
you know how it feels , all of these uncertainty , as long as you go back in the corridor , as the doctors are in one of the most remote ways , and you ask yourself what &apos;s going on here .
so , we would all feel sure and we would have a good time because we agree about the rules and agreed to be agreed .
we do everything to success , but then if we &apos;re there , we believe that we &apos;ve done it . we &apos;re going to be satisfied and hear all that , all that , what &apos;s going to make us successful .
i was faster , but as depressed .
i learned that success is not a street .
and the most hot thing is just full of hotter girls . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh my god , &quot; hopefully , for always the last time in public .
he was sure everything else is expanding .
it took 900 people to be part of it .
and the second is that people obviously experience a real connection .
these are questions .
as you see in modern liberal democracies , society allows us to determine our self , our self , but it also requires us from us .
it means we &apos;re going to meet our full potential as human beings .
so these are the layers that are the species that i wanted to lead to you today -- the question : what are the intentions that come to use if you design something ?
so i said , and my colleague sebastian is going to be a lot of the way that it has to give us better ways .
and we were successful .
i &apos;m going to give you one in the fall .
he &apos;s going to be in the right position , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit of the nose .
we learned the first surprise .
it had to give any kind of kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a lot to create the power of power and the speed that we observe and the system of the system .
a load signal is measuring forces and that &apos;s actually a piece of a load load on a crystal inside .
this is the most , the heel -- here &apos;s the heel , and that &apos;s going to meet and meet the load cell .
a very , very , very , very , very much problem for the special problem .
and upset : it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean .
i think that &apos;s one of the most beautiful classical things ever built .
i don &apos;t know other people &apos;s other , not even the time that it &apos;s just going to benefit that this is a three-dimensional space .
now you see that -- he just is going to be .
the submersible , the last year , was this one .
true is understanding architecture as a more , more , more , a , please , you &apos;re sorry -- isn &apos;t the right approach we need to choose .
basically , new york on the back of the world &apos;s back , and our streets were built over their shells .
in these eight side chambers , tiny of the flags are going to be small , which is basically going to be more sophisticated .
so you went around in london and was overwhelmed by this smell .
finally , the snow created a map of the outbreak .
and that &apos;s what happens every second week .
i made her portrait on the top of the gang .
and in this area of the amazon , in 1992 , oil was discovered .
the other side of the field is the bloodshed of the field , where actually , osama laden is going to be the store . that &apos;s a little bit of the time .
this was one of the great things .
this is the most important thing . let me move and show you the hubble field of deep field .
but then you get to jupiter and that &apos;s 40 minutes away . that &apos;s a problem .
this is going to be part of the beginning of the universe .
we only have a million galaxies , we have a million galaxies .
so the stuff is , in the picture , white matter .
when you saw this picture for the first time , they don &apos;t see much in it .
this simulation was taken with 1,000 processors a month , just just to do that , just to make this visible .
and we &apos;re with a resolution of food , we &apos;re going to have a resolution that &apos;s about this picture of the earth that you can actually see the complicated pattern of earth .
and in the consequence , we &apos;re stressed .
47 percent .
it &apos;s crazy . we &apos;re constantly doing it in the everyday life .
i went into a cycle . this led to many pain and problems with the joints so i could almost hold anything more .
so i asked myself , could you be creative if you look at intent for the constraints ?
the whole thing happened to be on tomorrow .
it &apos;s a mess of the most of the time , and it &apos;s a responsibility , as a kind of a computer system , and there &apos;s a lot of the water of the water , and the more compelling to the stone .
diane &apos;s famine of the 30s , the most , killed millions of dollars , killing millions of years in the &apos; 40s , they saw the nazis , they were burning , they were burning , and many of the women were going to be celebrated as a computer .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on to the grief . &quot;
and as a psychologist , the idea of most , most of us , we &apos;ve learned what we learned in the virtual world , and we could use our identity , using a better life in the real world .
we used to be used to a new way of being together alone .
human relationships are powerful , chaotic and the more , chaotic .
it &apos;s a lot of it .
because in the moment , in the people alone , even for a few seconds , they will be afraid , they get to take a electronic device .
but we &apos;re in danger , because in fact , the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently , we didn &apos;t have won every single with the most of our students who had predicted some of our students , and pretty often -- i felt that they had their predictions on financial ways .
maybe because my father has always read my father at night .
so i did it in quiet -- but it was very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very .
and finally , i thought , i was a pyramid , but i &apos;m missing the time that i &apos;m going to take a lot of time to take it out .
although you lose , no fear of failure when we gave it all the time , because who can have more desire to give you a more desire than anything he &apos;s going to do .
if i should call it names , i never know a answer .
did i have enough of the time ?
the second challenge would be cells .
today , in many clinical clinical trials , they &apos;re used to be used for heart disease for heart disease .
and just last month , it &apos;s been done with this technology that &apos;s going to create human health systems .
we can then map them and apply 360 degrees and analyze the kidney in all their overall properties , and then we can just take this information and print it through the world .
i couldn &apos;t be in school . i just went to the dirty .
i was a kid , i said what &quot; yes , that &apos;s what i want . i want surgery .
you may notice that a new area is called the crutches .
and connected with this kind of thing , there were examples of the world -- from the choice of a president to the most remote wikipedia and everything between the world &apos;s wikipedia .
third , the most , sterile environmental environmental environmental problems .
because what you need is that the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want a cd , i want to do the music you play .
i call joseph and i &apos;m a member in kenya .
we need to have our women and children , we need to run . &quot;
i try to improve the infrastructure .
late in the night , i went home with batteries and ice .
together : anybody &apos;s listening ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , to give the master to moscow and work in a hostile way to do this .
that can be huge spending , but if the city can win a number of x volunteers for y hours , the most the most of the time of the city is the city of the city .
they have a lot of the things , tables and data .
so , these are , in the 18 minutes , that were been able to be able to talk to me about this , between two and a half of them who are going to be in cities .
and he was in a computer of mud .
the building here have several stories .
these green things in the foreground are mangoes .
and if you &apos;re a legal legal system , you have political activities .
i couldn &apos;t know that i would be part of a technological revolution that would be true to this dream .
think about it . these guys who don &apos;t have the same thing , as i helped me , helped me get through her profoundly supportive support , go to the caribbean .
and then , in the time , they were working with a computer , but by using a computer , and he used a machine , and he could develop a machine that could read every single one of the things that could read every single one .
but you know , i think it &apos;s very lonely to read me from machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books over the border , in the different english countries , in the different english countries , u.k. , canada , canada , australia , australia , and new new types of harry potter had to have all different types of harry potter .
the most important thing . life has been doubled for a time , and it grows to a speed of five hours a day .
another thing . let &apos;s wish people like me , okay ?
second , the new machine machine is a good message , because , once the clusters of work , we don &apos;t need to do that , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and the most common thing is , and the way we get to do it is and the most common .
the social challenges of that inequality should be seen .
the economic game is surprising , and surprisingly , very straightforward , especially in short view .
and my biggest concern is that we create a world with a world , embedded in a little bit of a little bit of a society , and they supported by a economy that is the inequality instead of the way that inequality is going to promote .
in the course of the years , i started feeling more of the idea of god .
some have a few years of the fact that we can only believe that we can share our pain .
in the second , the line comes to the wind , and the waves are following him .
so who is god , if not the big most , or the most of the time ?
the loving soul of the universe .
by looking at the god in the inside . by the way , i &apos;m going to be able to get my own update .
one of the first things i started studying was the story of the world &apos;s story .
we &apos;ve been not found a lot of a time that were older than 40 years , and the average age of these hunters and the thylacine of tribes is 20 to 30 .
our bodies have used to this new diet .
so these equality of energy and matter , the einstein has shown and also the modern science of the world &apos;s , which is the entropy and information and energy and energy and energy . so it &apos;s a long continuum .
this is a robot that wants to stick its own appetite to get more electricity .
and what i mean is that we &apos;re looking at your own job .
a great development , which started billions of years ago , moving through us and put it on the way , and our choice is kind of in the technology , is really in it , which is a lot more powerful than we do .
they said , &quot; well , we have five classes of the two to 40 students .
we were going to get rid of all the way and found beautiful , and we found beautiful , and it had this -- while we were going to be told , &quot; you know what , it looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
so we waited , we sat on the tables and have waited .
there are many of the most powerful things that are , the only problem , especially for the adults who were working in the world &apos;s own , which didn &apos;t really know than they started , that there was only one toilet .
the teachers we work with -- everything is different for teachers -- they say what we should do .
about 170 decibels , with them , worked on the book and so wonderful .
and right behind -- there &apos;s usually a little chain -- right behind it , and it &apos;s been taught as children .
there &apos;s also this kind of thing -- it &apos;s a shelf that you don &apos;t see when you &apos;re in the middle of the world , but it &apos;s slow .
he &apos;s a lot of the time . he &apos;s bringing his cousins .
writing a email , he will tell you every question that you can answer .
i was this girl .
80 percent of refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s a page that thinks that peace is the end of the struggle , and there &apos;s a page that thinks that peace is the creation of schools and jobs .
she sent her children to school -- found a new home .
there &apos;s also one , which is the manual for complete idiots , did you know that ?
in cape , there are a lot of the streets , and we &apos;re all able to drive here .
this is my baby &apos;s baby . thank you very much .
he basically said , &quot; i &apos;ve designed everything . &quot;
and in a certain sense , i always felt bad .
so i came up with this kind of complications .
i found that cheetos are very good .
the university is the most difficult thing , so number 10 .
and from all of the strange , a strange , more than a window , which is excited about a window , to the moment that the street was black , and this white white was there in the sun .
and i was reminded by the great presentation of karen armstrong , that religion really understood nothing with faith , but to do with behavior .
the most , the same , has seen the same size . it doesn &apos;t look like this , but it &apos;s just the same size as the united states , the one of the same big as the state of arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the developed virus .
we can &apos;t wait to wait at the most remote , which had australia to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of our whole civilization .
a new appreciation of the world &apos;s , which we have through the assumption of this challenge .
before i show you a few pictures to the preview , i want to point on this beautiful detail about the design and design .
this is actually a really extraordinary school in this sense .
we &apos;ve been discussing a morning with keith , that many scientists don &apos;t tend to show something beautiful in their talks , from fear , as stupid as stupid .
here &apos;s what you can do , you can print a little bit in 3d , which is very interesting .
so that makes us think about what robots mean for us .
no . so i had to think a little bit of a little bit .
we did the same for iraq .
that was a challenge we had to ask as physicists .
we can press it up . the forces are more . there are more of them , but they &apos;re shining .
&quot; italian seven &quot;
and there are some employees in foundations that call this &quot; the &quot;
the idea of justice , which shows our lives , and we have a feeling of what &apos;s really in life , which is just in life , which is what we should do , social justice .
and as this is , he &apos;s a while of the most .
so every week , the most week would come to the world &apos;s . &quot; god , you have following me . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , an infection , an infection or a surgery .
the muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- the way that it &apos;s .
we treat them with the drugs -- the ones -- the , frankly , frankly , not very effective .
now you get a sense of it , like a lot of rock we &apos;re talking about here .
it was 1908 . it &apos;s not . so i can live .
i don &apos;t know if you can see it from the back of the back lines . that &apos;s just stars .
in 2005 , nasa started a probe called deep impact , which one -- with a part of the core of a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , like i said , engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we can have a more of the time and we can choose to change our future .
and i &apos;ve led to this time , and i &apos;ve led the only independent , to be exactly the only electronic medium of the country .
and i thought that the survival of survival , and a great company would be if the more , if you &apos;re just gone , what was going on as a right .
and at the end of the meeting , he says , look , it &apos;s not going to work , you &apos;re never going to see your money again , but my foundation will be 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test the idea .
and we said that -- that &apos;s okay , we &apos;re going to make your business plan with what they actually did .
look , we &apos;ve started in amsterdam and central development with our work and went to russia .
after a while , we opened a more of the time .
and we &apos;ve developed the idea , to spend bonds on the free press .
and you &apos;re organized the funding , so that it doesn &apos;t have any more than a blind , no blind , to find out .
so why works ? that &apos;s the question .
well , some of the things that are calling is a theory of everything .
just an example of this : newton found the law of gravity , which works like one of the square of the square of the world &apos;s disease .
the more symmetry you have , the better one , you get the simplicity and elegance of theory .
one thing he thought was most of us today , but to his time , it wasn &apos;t of course .
it doesn &apos;t know the importance of this fan that they follow the laws , and accidents .
but he read in every free moment he had books .
and that ambition , he was driven to the most , he went back to the most .
but when he was just in the way , his signature was to put out of the most deaf , and he was deaf , because he had a thousand hands during a computer .
not very surprising -- it was only three women under the 16 of the white house in the white house .
but i have to say , the older i became , the more i understand what was an incredible privilege to do with this aging lion of a man .
and so like lincoln , the story was told , all after the war after the u.k.
i asked my father under tears , &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
what the reason that is that i &apos;m always grateful for this strange love to be able to be able to spend a life back back to the past .
he had the temple and the temple .
this is the most important thing that &apos;s the evidence that the jews are looking for the deadline of exile in babylon , after all the years they were sitting in babylon and the memory of jerusalem , that these jews were going to go home .
all these are the cyrus .
the main cylinder is from the priests of the great , the danish of babylon , marduk , written .
they all know what happened .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of people came to tehran in the living jews .
some knowledge more about the living living , but you &apos;re still thinking that they &apos;re a kind of bad bad .
the new ones cried in the first few hours , but their needs were not even , and eventually they learned to be able to do it , and they were not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to do the air , and they start to start to go to the air , like all other .
a study shows that support support 10 percent of a sudden cost , while the most 30 percent costs .
and that was fascinated me , because i had almost spent my whole life .
you know exactly what you have to do to find a answer .
it was the marines there -- most of these friends and family .
we heard every single one .
but of course he never came . the explanation never happened .
and after many , many meetings i was excited that this man , a decent , is really one of my heroes and mentors , it did , to get the boat to get the boat .
so he said , well , we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones who believed in peace and their possibilities , etc . , and they were really going to be able to be .
we connect to the most remote -- i met a lot of the time , and i said , &quot; in london , &quot; in london , it &apos;s about the truce .
it &apos;s about their own business to do their business .
the biggest brains of the world should also be cognitively .
i went to the length of the number of the number of the number of this number , but i could never find them .
there &apos;s just a big brain brain .
and amazingly , it fits to the thing that our ancestors have invented 1.5 million years ago than they discovered the cooking .
very simple approaches for the most simple conversations that i led .
and i think i &apos;m just at the beginning .
but once the fight is going to be exposed to the physical rehabilitation .
behind him , a child was a child , his son , red in the face of effort , his father .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
and i spoke to my bosses at the night , and i told them -- i &apos;m going to say , &quot; look , we &apos;re looking at a few hours every day , just for some of the time . &quot;
two groups of the most remote , fighting .
so i asked him , &quot; what &apos;s it ? &quot;
&quot; but yes , we need to increase production from feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
and the most , not only in the orthopedic center , but also in the houses of people .
and you should see me during a computer of a computer .
and this hospital could have been able to afford to do it .
why ? because the way that i was going to be able to describe .
but i learned something more about that as the , which is that the leaders -- the managers of the economy -- were 15 bad decisions that have been brought to our economy .
because i knew that the state of african continent was important for my children and their children .
i try to get the experience that i had in a hostile way to bring africa .
is my time gone ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment from the one of the great society within a generation .
you &apos;ll notice that he &apos;s very similar to the most , very similar ball , the sun we draw as children .
in fact , that &apos;s something that &apos;s going to be a half of you , more than half , not being familiar .
32 pills &apos;s &quot; the visceral . &quot;
and the most important thing . &quot;
and that &apos;s the messages that you &apos;re giving you ?
because , in the end , the humanities love it , and it &apos;s going to bring them to television .
a professional , which is talking to dead , you don &apos;t get me ?
what is kofi ?
we &apos;d like to have a suggestions of you , like you &apos;re going to be a lot of the way to get a lot of the time , and the manufacturing government , so they &apos;re doing something .
thank you .
so the whole hospital is often going on to a generator .
it has to give a difference better . &quot;
but that &apos;s how the user can control whether there are electricity or not , because they can control the most , much percent of oxygen , how much percent oxygen you give .
but we want to be sure that this is the most effective and the most important device that we can put hospitals in .
the different species of writing in africa , the first was a , like the script , which is the script of a secret society of the secret in the world .
anyway , as a computer called a , john &apos;s favorite , john &apos;s favorite in the world &apos;s water in the world &apos;s ocean , which was in 1800 to 1900 , centuries of the last day .
almost one fifth of greenhouse gases comes from livestock -- that &apos;s more than traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and the helium of the helium and animals in the line like tools are not just so much .
and the one in the french was a french issue .
a picture of fish would be better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t quite bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question : i &apos;m going to ask you .
some of us would be my , maybe that &apos;s not that bad .
about a year ago , i asked myself , &quot; why am i , although i know what i know , no a vegetarian ? &quot;
at the weekend , you have the choice .
you can make a picture with a iphone , and all the names , even though it &apos;s sometimes a mistake .
they &apos;re distracted . he eventually wins the race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would be my , it &apos;s about interest , more about finding out when the professional the dollar is so high , but it &apos;s a very powerful area .
or an aesthetic experience -- an sunset or a big artwork .
the human nature has to change .
but part of the reason -- and that &apos;s why we have an ethical level in the process of the world -- is that they &apos;re intrinsic .
it could be more complicated in humans , but maybe not very .
jh : is it a fool to play with these forces ?
and so i knew that i need something to remote control .
so there &apos;s a lot of the time , because it &apos;s a dynamic , because it &apos;s the dynamic behavior of liquid .
and so i think that you can be a lot of it .
this is a great illustrator in the studio .
we take the pizza , our first pizza , and the individual slices , as the messenger in the hallway , and we &apos;re going to be in the hallway .
i was sure 20 , before i first went in a art museum .
i thought , okay , you have some criteria like you want to pick the works .
it &apos;s not photoshop work .
they &apos;re interested in creating an alternative , alternatives , and they needed money for that , so they decided to make some interesting batiuk projects .
this project is called &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so we went to the grave and made this , it was doable -- the attention we got .
and she describes how the most of the time -- everything you say is because of the most of the time .
he &apos;s a kind of a computer &apos;s favorite of the world &apos;s favorite , and it &apos;s also an artist .
it depends together with origami . so .
people used mathematical principles to understand the underlying rules .
or they &apos;re going to go to the top and do 50 stars on a flag with 13 milligrams .
how would you make a single flap ?
we &apos;ve found these rules with these images you put circles , you covered the most remote with lines , the extra rules . that makes the pattern .
you can do lots of things .
but if you want to make it bigger , you could need something origami .
and that doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re going into space or whether you go into a body .
i grew up in a new school in the state of washington with too much free time on the state of washington .
we just have three minutes . but we &apos;re talking about this .
and so i want to talk about that , because if we don &apos;t recognize it , this transformation will be very painful .
and in a moment , i &apos;ll show you a graph , and what you &apos;re going to see in the graph -- it starts in 1973 , just before the women start to put the market market , and it goes to the day .
you gave instructions from top .
because i write about all this book , i still have a book , and that &apos;s why i don &apos;t have any answer .
and that was very daunting for them .
and we haven &apos;t completely been completely helpful to us , come back to the form of culture , in this strange and a way , where you can see that the judgments change .
there &apos;s no man or no woman who is in the middle and it &apos;s the wires to optimize .
and the personal income on a scale that was held to be constant to consider inflation , in this time , is more than doubled , almost tripled .
and to hear me , and to understand what i say , you need about 60 bits per second .
and it &apos;s still happening , so in the last book of me called &quot; good business , &quot; i interviewed some ceo that was very successful by your environment as a very successful and very ethical , with great social sense .
control is also a safe thing , because you feel in your mind , but not very shaky .
&quot; where are you born , grew up and went to school ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they had their own meaning of what &apos;s home , and they had their significance for community , and even for hostility , which was given them to the way .
more and more people are in the future or present , as well as the past .
i went down into the room where i should sleep .
and the most of the time , where is you at home ?
there was a big gap between the industrialized countries and the two billion in the developing world .
but that &apos;s the world we have today . no gap .
and let me show you why , by the way , i &apos;m going to get a digital technology .
the kids are the new green .
and again , they were better than we said , &quot; you &apos;re the british and your mortality mortality in heart disease . &quot;
but if you have people , you don &apos;t change the high number of heart disease .
and i immediately started working with the work of the way , and then they were growing , and then i worked with a lot of the time -- mice that couldn &apos;t produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my favorite , and of course , i don &apos;t know how old she is .
you could be in the summer as well as the equator .
certainly many progress , many of the most powerful lives .
that &apos;s actually real photography , in time , that shows that the framework is in less days .
and here you see what &apos;s happening six months later , which is technically more accurate .
a blood blood is from two different types of cell cell .
we &apos;re going to put it back into this oven-like device .
much more complex organs . with distance , the most complex solid organs are high , with every amount of friction , like heart , liver and kidney .
this is still in the most remote .
we prefer cells that are not going to be fooled and not produce tumors .
we only need five seconds .
for every problem there would have a idea out there .
so , i &apos;m immediately in panic -- unlike all the palm and sugar that i had -- but this is a really amazing thing for an entrepreneur .
that doesn &apos;t mean you have to visit a computer .
i went from door to door and sold bike .
it &apos;s like a recession . so there &apos;s a recession .
and you would make these chairs .
this is useless . &quot; you have to find a way to get faster to get money .
i sold a lot of a bunch of the monthly .
they don &apos;t get a regular income , but they have the possibility of other tasks and learn , and they learn the ability to find the ability to find other possibilities .
if you go into a restaurant , and you &apos;re going to use bad action , you &apos;ll show you how bad credit credit looks like .
these young , pairs .
the development of the students today is to throw all interests of a board .
the most of the most remote , or a more of the cultural ones , is taking the most of our students .
the values of the past also are going to be able to be able to get a lot of society .
but it &apos;s a politics of principles , not the most of the time .
they have a mind . and they have other people .
what we should do when we think about conservatives -- except this case of the 1980s -- what it is : you go to church .
yeah , i know you don &apos;t really believe that .
and that doesn &apos;t just lead to another outcome , it has changed the potential to change how we deal with each other .
completely different .
and actually , it &apos;s not a rights , but clearly -- let me finish that -- creative commons offers authors a simple way to put their content with the freedoms that they want to leave them .
john hockenberry .
and i wonder how often this happens .
he told me that he was the most popular , and then he said , &quot; there &apos;s a snake in the next room , and we &apos;re going to be there now . &quot;
so , for today , i had the idea that i run them through this process and show them how this journey looks like .
and the hospital and general electric electric system were also happy .
i lived , just with that we &apos;re really going to understand .

the first question is , and maybe you write them , either on a sheet of paper , physically , or on a virtual sheet in your head , and , for audience , you can also try that : you can try and try that .
and we &apos;re going to break up , &quot; we &apos;re the best scientific college of the world , &quot; because of our british failures .
except , you -- you &apos;re in the way -- now , in your tadpole , you thought , &quot; hmm , what happens during night ? &quot;
and one of the most difficult problems is when people have a notion of how everything works , it &apos;s pretty difficult to change this .
and as an expert for a decent chemistry , i have friends and colleagues who differ between the organic , living world and the inorganic world .
and you can see , he &apos;s going to get out of it , growing up in a way .
we even have amazing life forms that we can manipulate .
and darwin himself asked a letter to a colleague that life probably came out in a warm little pond -- maybe not in scotland , maybe in africa , maybe somewhere else .
what is life ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can connect them and literally create thousands and thousands of really large molecules , in the same size as dna and proteins , but it &apos;s not carbon in view .
we want to put them in the environment and we want them to get their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can create different biology , and it can bring matter to be able to be able to define that , then that &apos;s what life is going to define .
but there &apos;s another reason why i like this development of development : every single one is going to measure .
and these are very professional female males who sit on an hour for an hour and ask her to ask her to ask her .
i was really sitting on friday , and i could see how the mortality rate was in the morning of the child &apos;s mortality .
how you know , these economists love money , they always want more and more of them .
as you can see , it doesn &apos;t make sense to calculate a average average from a improvement that &apos;s not been and very fast progress .
but you don &apos;t talk about this much .
in which there were high , or very high , child mortality and the families were very big , six to eight .
here &apos;s also a fixed thing .
whatever is more worth money .
yeah , i went barefoot , until i was 12 .
and he told them , &quot; imagine the most important thing .
the whole time was a border .
and the world &apos;s thinking , after my opinion , will get forward to get a difference , not just a few , but for every one .
... above the knee , yes , that would be difficult ...
the most , it took about 10 years , and 700 million dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth gives enough to mobilize everybody , but not everybody &apos;s greed .
and emails die .
i went to high school .
when i was at the council of scientific exploration research research -- 40 labs -- when two of the people don &apos;t have any languages , i built teams .
they &apos;ve been made and now i &apos;ve got apps in the app .
it &apos;s about perfect to perfect and to lead something old to the 21st century .
it &apos;s still very hot , but not more revolutionary .
but this reactor isn &apos;t under high pressure , and the bureaucratic is not so unpredictable , it means that the most , the world &apos;s not tend to leave the reactor .
i &apos;m convinced that the reactor i designed here is a innovative energy system that &apos;s great scientific projects with electricity and i &apos;m really ready to do this .
we move to a more of the time that the experience is the actual product .
there &apos;s a manufacturers of the most important thing that &apos;s the case that they &apos;re going to go in the forest .
the end of a long ceo of advice that he &apos;s going to have his son , he says , &quot; especially , &quot; it &apos;s a lot of the time to yourself , &quot; well , it &apos;s a lot of time to yourself .
you don &apos;t usually go to los angeles , but there &apos;s a place where you can walk a lot of walking out in this city .
then they will be wrong as a fake , as a result of the way , by the way , by the way they &apos;re not having a lot of the properties that they don &apos;t have .
when i was small , i was very privileged , and i &apos;d like to be a lot of a lot of a lot of myself .
then it was just about a point , and then they &apos;re going to build them to the end .
so i built it from concrete , because it doesn &apos;t matter .
this was this tool .
and for me , this is the most important thing . because since i was a kid , i wanted to convey my passion and love .
25 days : the smartest , 32 days : poor and hands are developing 36 days : the primitive spine starts to train this weeks , the annual fetus .
the complexity , this is a single system , again , beyond each understanding or any of the existing math .
because apparently there &apos;s this kind of mess of the body of the atmosphere of the stars in the atmosphere of iceland .
so what can you do with these cheetos ?
recently , a colleague sent me from berkeley , a colleague of berkeley , a email with a very interesting spectrum and asked , &quot; can you look at this ? &quot;
there are two ways -- over the world &apos;s and the stars -- on the matter and chemical elements in the universe and the other thing .
because can you imagine that everything is going to be ?
now imagine a object , an incredible object , or something that we can &apos;t explain and we &apos;re just on , and we &apos;re just saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to work . physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
and if we see the most of the time , and oxygen , i think , we have the perfect e.t. .
i just said , &quot; really ? &quot; and he said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what i can tell you about is , it &apos;s universal ; we all have them .
i &apos;m easy to get a little hooked , but that &apos;s another talk .
this led to a little breakdown -- -- that &apos;s actually more like this .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is , no more , no more , no more , no more . &quot;
what are you feeling vulnerable ? &quot;
i &apos;ve right , you don &apos;t have right . wait .
we do that as if we have , no impact on other people .
people are the people who are in twitter , the drums of their children on the iphone .
so if we think about it , they &apos;re using systematic improvements to make a systematic , and we think about how to be useful to our most useful , for our most of our most , for our most of our most , and embracing .
and today i want to talk about one of the things that we decided to do at the time we wanted to find a new access to health care .
so steven is going to divide his story . but it &apos;s not alone .
here , why people pray .
i love this kind of thing , also , that was the only one that were online and available .
and here we have a paper .
you don &apos;t have any more of the data , you don &apos;t have data that &apos;s going to go to scientific methods .
this is the curve over the world &apos;s .
but my brother didn &apos;t go to him , and it was at the end .
if we went from here to the most remote , we would be able to get to something that 300 meters tall , 120 miles long , and the two of the two peaks weighs .
to change the state , you need only two volts of a computer .
we said , &quot; can you build that ? &quot;
we can do better .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that comes from the so-called the so-called .
so , the result is the metaphor of the ideal representations of complex systems .
and it also has implications on the supply of the supply of the supply .
so we could put a little bit of a rubber set of a little bit .
we see the emergence of the emergence and the programs that are going to be able to understand our connected world from the point of complexity .
and the most of the capacity have a capacity to do with the brain &apos;s capacity -- except you use expensive pumps and policymakers .
and we had 500 of these types of water systems .
without human being .
so we were up on our own .
and this graph doesn &apos;t even mean something that &apos;s invented data .
and my brain starts to think very quickly that this is a kind of a representation of negative to positive in the world .
because this question is that our external world can predict our own , but the truth is that i can only predict 10 percent of the person if i can make your entire external world .
and that &apos;s from two reasons scientifically , and it &apos;s wrong .
we &apos;re moving people to open up , if you open your own , a positive email of the world &apos;s own , or the most of the social environment .
and to say , a more difficult , you understand -- my father was the most popular man on the world .
and so i went . i went to mit , i went down .
they said , &quot; keep it stop .
they take a huge disk from cardboard .
he was the first digital media in tokyo .
listen to that ? how cows ? this is four o &apos;clock in a pastor .
so there are all these things to do , but most love i &apos;m doing it , to taste the world .
and i was doing that with passion .
your culture is not coming in schools , and i want to give you ways to get this problem .
that makes it nervous because girls don &apos;t want to go to schools where there are no boys .
and over little moments in my life .
or mothers who have the young ones ?
we need to change the posture to young school in elementary school .
and you have the impression that you believe that it would be okay .
let &apos;s see where this hypothesis is going to be .
is that a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we think that we can give that &quot; why &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
i &apos;m going to try and do that at the end , and i &apos;m also excited if it works .
and that was really a important lesson for me that you can &apos;t really make a object .
so , for example , we created a newspaper , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s linked to radio with my ipad , and that &apos;s a software that goes on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a computer system . so i put them around a computer , so that people are responding to the glass of the glass , when you get to them .
i &apos;m going to turn out of my current in a man , and then in a old man .
and the extra extra thing was allowed .
radio : what do you think ?
fold just the wings together and drive it .
so i &apos;m going to ask you another question .
and he took a royal of the royal , with the instructions , the instructions , he had a day and night , but with the secret instruction , not particularly good to get it .
because they found that the human behavior is stronger .
yet , we have to make a clear kind of a very clear thing , which is what you can create this kind of value . and it &apos;s also a lot of fair .
now , if we all have these tools to have , we have to just ask the question -- and they have done this -- and they did this -- how we use these smart .
they &apos;re going to lead the new of the new people .
they give small , they &apos;re going to be a little bit of the time .
i felt passion , soul and heart , had my body left .
audience : no .
sb : no , not .
all around us , the most different , and it &apos;s a different replicator in this kind of brain of culture .
they probably bought them .
imagine the world full of brains and more memes than a place for them .
we are the only more of the ones and the most remote .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
that was dangerous , but hello .
they use us to make the resource of the planet to produce more and more computers , and more amazing things that we &apos;re hearing here at ted .
and will we get this third danger , how do we have the second and the first one ?
in collaboration with the most remote -- that &apos;s the most , in haiti -- with the ministry of public , with different types of things , we inspected more than 1,500 buildings .
it &apos;s not going to cost us , if we do it right . &quot;
and because i had burning 70 percent of my body , took the whole one about an hour .
we also found that it would have been good , you &apos;d have given me a lot of the pain to recover me from pain .
and how bad would the punishment be if i would caught ?
it wasn &apos;t that the most , people -- the ones who have more commandments -- less cheated , and that the less religious -- those who could not remember any commandments .
so if you don &apos;t think of a few seconds , because you &apos;re not going to think of money , does it make a difference ?
it &apos;s like this : that &apos;s like this .
i think all these forces are very bad effects on the stock market .
but you can believe me . i work in the commercial .
these are the most remote ones i can show you today .
and suddenly amazon will be brand to brand and it &apos;s the budget , defined how they want to spend their money , what money is and what it is .
maybe that seems to be a big leap ?
and the audience is not going to have to explain it -- last week , i had to explain my girl -- skeletons are structures that are the teenage of a individual .
and i knew that animals like the most , or even the most animals are not to stabilize their tissue by putting them over bones .
and that was that every skeleton we found to the nature of nature , and the same thing that we had to do is the same thing .
all i showed that was really surprised about it .
a funny song about global warming , by jill behar .
well , i have to be now .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a piece ?
and the most , more , more , and the most remote , are the benefits of a great education .
the most of the time of the world &apos;s most made of it , and ben became a kind of a computer .
is it going to go , what is the area of this character ?
i was forced to leave my home , the democratic republic of congo , where i was a lot of the time .
but remarkably , the united nations has estimated the public health of the country on 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not at the goal .
they have to be very inexpensive to be available .
but could not be done for this angle of labor labor ?
they asked the governments to be able to have natural groups , and in many cases they have them .
but let &apos;s take our goal to the goal , and we &apos;re going to act in the basis of the pyramid .
because they need a whole bunch of these little transactions to make their profit .
he liked to sit on her lap because he said it was painful for him to be in his own bed .
since the last time , when sir &apos;s , and the british society was held for the world &apos;s sun that that &apos;s why the sun seems .
so , what is fusion ? here &apos;s something more .
and this energy is that the fusion is breaking .
so , about a very high power of conventional power .
we need to make it a power station .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country , and it &apos;s also a big impact .
it was most of the democracy , but they were the most countries that were in the world in the last month , and they were just four percent .
but the expectations of people were given to their future .
so the question is , &quot; what does the male support for women &apos;s support is ? &quot;
i promise you , she &apos;s read the message .
nobody can listen to them , they just send a text .
they could see the immediate effects of laws or the one of the things that are going on to a computer model , and see what happens as a result .
the flight took 12 seconds and went over 35 .
this is the scene for a rocket .
he weighs less than a more of a sudden .
from the smallest forces of the world &apos;s brightest forces .
we can afford to do as individuals , and we &apos;re hearing hearing .
we believe that somebody else , somebody else , someone &apos;s , somebody &apos;s own , someone with more tools of this problem will solve .
we didn &apos;t flew it in the pacific .
it took 10 full prototypes until we had something that really flew .
and so there &apos;s a page that &apos;s going to be that incredible , which is possible , and that huge serious thing that means that it means .
and we think of our moral , and we &apos;re thinking about our moral .
and the director was pretty a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very crazy thing , and he said to me , &quot; this place is a monthly . these guys are severe offenders .
it took several of these events to do what i should do .
when i started with this program four years ago , my favorite plan was a computer plan to create a computer .
and you look down to the most little , everything is so small and tiny .
i feel blessed and happy that i had the courage 15 years ago to give my post to the korean record , and in my country , where i can get this incredible rides with this group of ethiopia , morocco and russia .
and how often would my self die before i would understand that it &apos;s not enough to have ?
and i was a really good dancer .
td , the insights of this insight not my low self-worth , this feeling of otherness .
that was because i didn &apos;t have any myself , which was in between .
imagine what kind of existence we could have , if we honor the inevitable death of self , the privilege of life and the happy thing is coming next .
and this is a cafe on the sea in the u.k.
but instead of focused on the way we &apos;re focused on how .
we also discovered that as a kind of a structure , and a kind of a way of getting through this structure .
but we found that seeds -- this really important project , is just a lot of the project -- but that seeds -- in the leading projections , are not going to be the seeds .
we worked with a computer system to develop a match of the seed , so even if you &apos;re visually visually , it &apos;s kind of a lot of the way that you see this .
it &apos;s actually just the first few people who are going to recognize , and the rest is just for postcards .
the book is wearing the title called &quot; blank slate , &quot; which is the popular notion of the human mind , and all his structure of his tadpole , culture , education and experience .
well , there &apos;s a series of political reasons that they like to be good .
it &apos;s still not clear whether these metrics are adaptive , but the most , though , seemed to be the most remote thing .
another one of the most unhealthy and the most of the people who are in the universities are actually in the decline .
well , the other hot iron is the parenting .
and i think you can &apos;t tell this better .
i also call a marketer , just like this , and you don &apos;t like it , but they don &apos;t confirm it .
there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no a nonsense .
he says , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i think right now . &quot;
oh , i live in a computer program -- that &apos;s strange .
so i asked myself what would happen if we challenge some of these types of water .
right ?
it &apos;s like , we &apos;ve got the war to explain the war when society , every one of us .
your iphone without the people who are the same skin , same circuits , the same keyboard , always make and again .
and then it was always more powerful and more powerful and now it &apos;s a long time .
and i said to brian : &quot; what did tony do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; is it true that you &apos;re going to be able to be able to get here ? &quot;
but how do you sit on a mentally normal way ?
so all of these things were all the things that came on on tony &apos;s , proof of his own consent that he was crazy to this new way .
he came into the affordable business and the 30 percent of the workforce , turned american cities just like this in the world .
and i added up , &quot; i have a list of a bacchanal in my pocket .
and the jewelry are always the most powerful aspects of the personality of the idea .
and that &apos;s what it was , that was two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended up .
in fact , the trend was going to the rest of the world .
and as a result of this conversations , it &apos;s very , very difficult to say , i represent the true islam . &quot;
it may be that a big war between east and west was used to be necessary to be necessary in the framework of democracies .
and even though the president , from the president , really , very , very good to do that , is not the enemy of islam , there &apos;s a natural impulse in the other side of the other side .
when the treasure was dropped in 2000 , you saw the peak of the best , the scientists who have ever had the most likely to the most endangered of african penguins .
the day after our arrived , two of us were in the face of the room about the building of two of us . space two people fought more than 4,000 with oil .
we &apos;ve been using this method in the treasure rescue again .
and that &apos;s really important because african penguin was explained a year to a endangered way .
on the world row , the most on the world &apos;s row , in front of a computer , in the world &apos;s , and even before the police police .
people are open for the most remote .
we launched this campaign -- very fun -- &quot; every egg counts . &quot;
this is not a second of the second grade .
these lessons came to the face of the abstract , abstract .
thom asked himself a leg and said , &quot; what you &apos;re doing is not that you &apos;re not doing your neighbors . that &apos;s the rest of the rest . the rest are comments .
now , this is not the whole story .
and achilles takes a body body , and the way it &apos;s careful is the father , and the two men see each other and see each other as a crank .
this is what the cells really did me in biology and science , which looks like living cells in the microscope .
every grain of sand has a tenth of a tenth of a millimeter .
you can see these kinds of things .
this picture was the beginning of the most popular .
we &apos;re all looking at the same from inside , believe me .
the walls are 700 mm thick , solid concrete .
and that &apos;s an x-ray on the left .
it has human association .
in x-ray , we see all the little little more of the little little more .
i had to have the car in the middle of the middle , for himself not really simple task .
yes , they gave 12 monkeys to a week , and after this week , they just used them as a toilet .
science actually says that we &apos;re going to live forever .
no , i &apos;m going to get a tooth out .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you . goodbye .
where we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we &apos;re both not agree .
not professor and learning , only two spirits , ready to get to the most .
and then my life was fine .
everything i saw in the manufacturing was that it was right to the most intellectual between the most remote and the most remote .
would it be time to process information ?
we spent a lot of time with a billion dollars , and you &apos;re listening to a billion dollars , and it &apos;s a billion of the time that he was involved in , and what we found was shocking , but later , more .
then there &apos;s dan depp .
we were thrilled that these companies had fast their own business systems and the most important in london in london .
that &apos;s too complex and difficult to change it .
we &apos;re going to die all the time . we &apos;re all going to be sick . we &apos;re all going to leave people . people leave us .
there are places that you can &apos;t go to , you know , you can &apos;t think of the worlds that you can &apos;t recover anymore .
they have a more of the time and a freedom i believe that they &apos;re the foundation of a new computer .
she has met the decision , not getting a more of the time or a more , but your life is that this is not happening .
we &apos;re all refugees .
but you &apos;re going to get this thing to the head , and then this is what happens .
but it doesn &apos;t do it . &quot;
i miss michael .
it didn &apos;t find it , but he didn &apos;t have his employees , but they said , &quot; you go into the recovery , or you &apos;re going to be fired . &quot;
ah ! we meet them , the legal beloved . let &apos;s pull it off .
if it &apos;s on the box , which is the most important thing that &apos;s the most important thing that &apos;s the most .
the characteristics that is the word of the word is so often in adults , that we should eliminate this age of the age of the age , if it comes to criticize behavior , that &apos;s associated with the most reliable and irrational thinking .
if i &apos;m the ability to get the ability to get 10 percent interest , i &apos;m going to get to get rid of your last loan , i &apos;m going to be able to get your ability to get more money to get to you .
it &apos;s why we don &apos;t live in the dark times .
and the third is all the sounds that we create people that are the most remote .
this is after selective &apos;s .
there are many of the most sophisticated of the greenhouse gases , under other people , like animals , and they taught us to dance and sing for another time that i &apos;m going to do .
so that was extremely embarrassing .
and if you wonder how much that is , this is the most powerful one here , 16 kb .
so 37 is our audience .
it &apos;s very impressive and a very beautiful concert .
and these are the themes that are actually the heart of us .
one generation that &apos;s so much more meaning from video games , as from the real world .
all of these are problems outside my report .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of video games means for our civilization .
finally ! finally ! that was .
it would be really good .
so , you get fast from the simple , if you do more . that &apos;s what we like .
and then they &apos;re looking at them , and it &apos;s a liberal -- i thought that at least long time , i thought that it &apos;s a little bit more , to think about it .
it &apos;s going to go to the other direction .
girl : there was a sphere and a half , because it &apos;s two completely different amounts of energy , and if you fall it at the same time , maybe you fall out .
but we could not train a thousand new teachers to save our lives .
and it &apos;s a kind of a more . &quot;
and we &apos;re going to be able to move ourselves to the world &apos;s same way to do the world around us .
this is going to have incredible implications .
why do you do what you do ?
everybody would want to do the new version .
they &apos;re going to affect us too .
they &apos;re even going to be over the time .
i &apos;m going to go back to his words right now .
&quot; well , yes , &quot; i said , &quot; funny , you ask that .
it &apos;s like , &quot; you don &apos;t need to do it again . &quot;
we saw that , and i was grateful because she just said , &quot; wow ! this is madness . &quot;
the goal of the project is very simple .
this is completely personalized medicine in the world .
now the answer is a team of a team .
i work with the computer caps and the most serious thing , which is a few serious problems in the project , problems that don &apos;t have to have .
in medicine , there are so many people who don &apos;t want change , just not if a computer engineer has been willing to get the answer .
you can really find novel solutions that have been seen , and that &apos;s very quickly , and just fast .
yeah , good , you &apos;re going to put my life , because the most , you know , was about beautiful , more sophisticated form .
no , but it &apos;s true : the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i met the most of the time .
and i didn &apos;t ask them to draw nice cartoons .
thank you .
so , &quot; our lonely earth brought me to the meeting with the audience .
we have a lot of time for the existence of animals on this planet than they &apos;ve been here until we have the second microbial era .
his impact is the distribution of this very thin , very thin over the planet , and we had a very powerful death of the dinosaurs , death of these beautiful , and the most different .
it &apos;s the supreme table , the t. rex of his time .
they hate animals .
this is when material comes from the deep earth and the surface , spread over the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m a lot of the coast of the coast , which is going to happen with me ?
they have a crash . they have two options : they &apos;re going to die , or they &apos;re going to take the hydrogen sulfide and , say 75 percent of them will be saved .
and the blessing : blessing and lucifer .
some of you are countries who think that deregulation or no regulation of the best way is , investing in , trade , trade .
the answer is just : the chinese define these factories as chemical companies , not as a as a chemical , and check them .
i don &apos;t know what we can do , but i can use my office to bring them all together to develop a solution . &quot;
you need a safe environment .
now , we have the impression that it &apos;s about the beginning of a new way of the regulation of international tasks .
human rights will be a very simple question : can i give you this person back to this ?
or otherwise , the young to find the fire , the fire has put it , to see if you can change it . &quot;
okay , ready ? go .
i was fire and regina .
again , again , we saw how spoken poetry are poetry .
after the fight , he was going to be a his favorite hair , and he said , &quot; you &apos;re a god . &quot; no , anderson , you &apos;re the god . &quot;
i travel much , if i teach , and i don &apos;t always get to see how my students get their third step , but i had lucky to see her journey as well as they did .
my parents have called me , which is a name of a name .
i want to talk about some ideas that have driven me , to become a more of the time .
when i saw that the war for every time i saw this incredibly powerful consequences , and that the most powerful thing was in the conflict conflict , i wanted to be a photographer to be a photographer .
at the same time , in south africa , after nelson mandela was taken from prison , the black population of liberation is a last phase of liberation .
the next day i made myself on rwanda , and it was when i was up in the hell of the hell .
after the fall of the fall of the world , i started studying the conditions of poverty in a country that was on the way to the modernization .
a hospital of the doctors without borders in a refugee camp .
the most efficient is that the percentage of the soldiers , which are a mentor survival , is much higher than in any other in our history .
so , to ensure that so little as possible , we can get all these procedures in the choice .
so you choose to be .
but this is a wide and very difficult topic , so i had to hire myself .
the size of the population is the population -- here &apos;s a big china , here &apos;s a big india .
and in all eastern religions , the level of japan was the level .
because death is going to be a child &apos;s death .
and what is the reason in qatar ?
they have a great job .
all religions on the world are able to keep their values and adapt to these new world .
and then , as all of our generation , we lived in a computer system .
day eight .
in india alone , my favorite friends were best friends and i from door to door with this same picture , to every single house in india . we did over a billion of the years .
this is the most important thing .
i asked them -- it &apos;s all the most powerful -- and i asked them to ask them to ask them .
i think we owe debt of the mexican and ron st. john john john , i hope , ron is somewhere in the audience -- it &apos;s the founder of the mexican .
larry brilliant : first , are you not angry because of the injury of the patent of the patent ?
have built a computer system , &quot; the climate group . &quot;
why should we have a positive impact on the world , and the world , as a company ?
they save 85 percent of the electricity that they have used with a old light bulb .
sometimes people think that 100 percent will be pretty hard , and we had this conversation in business .
a more of the time , in seven or eight years , is paid .
from our bosses in the very ikea , 47 percent of women are 47 percent women , but that &apos;s not enough and we want to close this gap to high management .
there was a equation in my family , about this : if you &apos;re smart , you &apos;re not spiritual .
this is , he wrote , &quot; is the playful structure of reality . &quot;
anyone who &apos;s going to be able to hire it or the point of the ears .
the end of our favorite system , we realized the openness of the other .
and as i was going to go back to bangalore , and often i was going to go to the very depressing discussions in my friends , where we &apos;ve been experimenting with different topics while they were going to have a drink of the new world , where they have paid their 14 years old .
he &apos;s looking for forgiveness , and he said he wants to make life better to improve his child child .
this is the world epidemic seemed quite happy to be very happy , and it had no deaths to be killed even though dozens of thousands of times in liberia have been killed .
and how are we responsible for this ?
it &apos;s an alarming -- not ? -- that the media of the world is doing a bad job that a small group of activists in the situation is to publish more of this kind of information than the rest of the press .
j yeah . that &apos;s the cover in the guardian and it was in all countries around kenya , in the world and south african press .
j the effects of people who worked on it were largely terrifying .
and there are a lot of information .
i would be interested in what we &apos;ve heard -- i &apos;m curious to think of the ted audience .
and we said , &quot; oh , tell us more .
so you have to be careful with the term hackers .
and just a month ago , it was passed from the most of the most of the time parliament .
and from all these numbers , i start just two or three variables .
this piece of view can be read very different , depending on where you &apos;re going to get it .
first , i read about this in a timeline in a timeline , which was between the most common medicine and seven .
so according to this study , the best thing is to be a chicken for a chicken , but not to let it be in the long way , but it &apos;s not to let a lot of a non-zero-sum , brown sugar or water .
and then , in the next summer , i worked under the line of dr. &apos;s , texas , texas .
and this realization is incredibly interested in efficiency , maybe for many different cancers .
for example , the most devastating organic connections are chemical pollutants that are found in our schools , care and the workplace .
because all of these solutions are , of course , they &apos;re sustainable and they &apos;re a lot of them -- the most of our generation and for the next generations .
and immediately , a voice called &quot; tick ! &quot;
after the conference , after my talk , people came to me , men and women .
hard !
a prosthetic is not more for the need , a lack of the need .
we &apos;re all different from different perspectives .
i was as an beijing , and i was going to be able to go to the olympic games .
about 80 percent of these of the most of these things are young people .
and they &apos;re most of the unemployment , and they &apos;re most of the , the main of the banks , the banks of the banks , the most of the world &apos;s , and america , the products they produce .
they have a kind of tools that you can put on a piece of chicken or fish , and it looks like cattle .
people think about the question : will we keep going to keep our environment further to the higher gdp ?
there &apos;s nothing up there , but the conditions were ideal for the winter .
well , the series was not even left , so they &apos;re the first ones that get this .
mars is similar to the earth , it seems like the earth &apos;s same .
sousa had fear that we had the opportunity to lose the possibility of these , quote , &quot; machines . &quot; they would take us .
but much more importantly , that astrolabes used to create accessible works to create new amounts of information that they &apos;re free to do for free . then in the year , when a movie was a hurricane , the majority of the channel came to heroism .
and i ...
for the balance i &apos;m trying to do , i &apos;m trying to ask as a good fortune of of course , something from the government . a mistake , not true ?
this realization is incredibly powerful , incredibly , very powerful .
okay , i want anybody to be skeptical , but i &apos;m just noticed that the person on the right is a liar .
&quot; honey , you don &apos;t see fat in it , no . &quot;
but another study showed that strangers are going to lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their first 10 minutes .
here &apos;s a cartoonist with her kittens .
i &apos;ll say it again .
and look at liars a little bit of the eyes .
we say , &quot; yes , as we shake the head .
science has a lot more abstract to daylight .
look carefully , and you &apos;ll see the whole smile that &apos;s going to be the complete smile .
in this such way , it can be a lot of the world &apos;s way to be able to be a little bit more likely to be in terms of our moral rules .
and that &apos;s not true , right ?
you know , we often think language is the world that we live in , but that &apos;s not true .
so what &apos;s like a more of the time , if not even tragic joke , about harry , and the way ethnic is .
six months after no explanation , they were going to get me free .
this is what i &apos;m going to do .
when i was 10 , i &apos;ve read james &apos;s &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new song i proposed to you .
so i took a little time to study coke .
and in the remote areas of africa , it &apos;s hard to find a good road .
how do you have to get to the effects based on the effects that you act on these remote villages ?
i don &apos;t mean that as pleasant as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they &apos;re waiting for being cut .
much more people were been recycled .
today i &apos;m going to tell you two things . first , what we &apos;ve lost , and second , how we put it .
here you can see the biggest part of the living of the florida of florida .
if there &apos;s no fishing fishing , because it &apos;s protected , or the isolation , then it &apos;s great .
after a few years after five to seven years , the fish come back , food , and then grow the algae .
you can see the border of the world &apos;s border because there are the boats all back .
if it &apos;s so good , if that &apos;s so easy , how much is there ?
so the protection of the sea , and the ocean is to be a depression for money and the oceans , and that &apos;s not acceptable .
in the coral reefs , we found that the pyramid is the equivalent of the equivalent to the most remote , where five lions come on a computer .
okay , so , , in the mexican , thank you that you have a part of your spiritual life . thank you .
it has been in the sea .
they come to the submersible -- they come to the eyes and look at the submersible .
and we &apos;re trying to do with our partners in the woods of the ocean hole , these virtual world -- these world , this is the world , to get this .
bl : these worms don &apos;t have a more of the way . they don &apos;t have mouth .
what we &apos;ve seen was from the pacific .
we &apos;re going to try to show you the pacific in the middle of the city .
these worms grow several inches in the week !
the concept of the world &apos;s concept is a fixed .
and the rest of a percent of the percent of the one is looking for the formula they can apply in the situation .
they also have the mathematical structure that &apos;s from the most of the , measurements , the points , points , points , and the sound of it .
the students have to create this . they have to make them work .
and the best , or one of the best parts , is that we don &apos;t get the answer to the end of the world &apos;s end .
what &apos;s going on with the small hadron collider ?
here you are going to find the fastest growing population in the world .
it &apos;s a lot of the time . there &apos;s no state schools in the slums .
this is a computer that was installed at the entrance to her slum from a photo-real social entrepreneur called sugata , which took the most powerful experiments that showed you that children are going to learn under certain conditions .
well , the key is motivation , and it &apos;s in two ways .
this is a school in a bus in a bus in a site in the fusiform city of asia .
they should turn it into a mcdonald &apos;s .
there are formal frame , schools , the hospitals , hospitals , in which innovation can be place , and informal environments , communities , families , social networks .
every child to age 15 , which is a place in a school , 2015 , will be able to get a place .
and while i look at him , this scene comes to tears , and i &apos;ve been doing that for 25 years .
here &apos;s a few parents of teenagers , and all of us have to cook for them -- and they &apos;re going to eat every night for two , three or four . it &apos;s ridiculous .
he &apos;s going to go anywhere , and it &apos;s more expensive .
these gay guys like me are treated as a full citizen , and it &apos;s just written in front of our nose .
there &apos;s a fear of people who have to have their job , so they don &apos;t show who they &apos;re really , here at us . it &apos;s not just north carolina ; in all states without color , it &apos;s legal .
think about it .
and i was afraid .
about three years ago , i read a article in new york times .
who were my grandparents ?
they helps us to be what we could have .
so evolution works .
and in fact , here &apos;s this insect .
i &apos;ve been bored before one of someone .
he &apos;s not just about 43 to 44 degrees c for about two days , but it &apos;s a constant temperature .
but contrast is about this . it &apos;s going to be out of the background .
here &apos;s the russians who are going to give the russians , and yes , it was -- actually -- a game .
she started telling me about this , and all the parents are going to recognize the most , the most .
i have a nonprofit story .
our lives will be determined by data , and the presentation of this data is for us to create an opportunity to make fantastic interfaces that can tell great stories .
i also put a look at the different of the different types of things , because you can pick out what you want to highlight from the data .
it &apos;s a man who &apos;s sitting in the box and controls this kind of thing .
a more of the 11 sheep per hour , which is a kind of 68 of 68 cents .
and in the reason you can see , what you see on the left is the most , and look at the frame of the side , you see the frame of 16 people who have no idea what they do .
and the mountain bell : the mountain &apos;s mountain , the mountain , the ice , and we took all these individual pieces and the most remote pieces of the pieces of demand .
but we knew we needed to take the right person to put us behind us and build something we could build .
and below all the other frames , people who have been able to ruin the project .
thank you .
so i made rows of images , cut them together , and she added them together .
a documentary of it is that you &apos;re always seeing one part of his image , and that leads to a very free cycle .
and sometimes i have a emotional response to news , like the earthquake in haiti .
then i went 50 miles , then 60 miles .
it &apos;s like the different layers we &apos;re doing , and what we &apos;re going to do is present the world as our identity .
another thing is in a public library in san jose , california .
so every building has its own personality .
it &apos;s perhaps easier than ever before , a good living .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re particularly competitive .
it &apos;s just too strange .
you know , in the middle ages , in england , if you met somebody who was very poor , you called this one unhappy . literally , somebody who &apos;s lucky , not a , the fate , not a , the fate .
and it &apos;s going to make it the youngest court with angels and the sky , and the sky will open up .
i told them the action of the circular system .
what i think i think , really , is success , and failure .
we should make sure that we are really the creator of our own civic .
alain de botton : a more , decent , a decent
if you train this sport , you don &apos;t smile .
you know , you &apos;re going to go to the color of the goggles , and you &apos;re going to go 60 trains a minute , so you &apos;re never really going to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
they &apos;re in the liquid .
my breath is down on three of the time .
and that &apos;s what i want to worry about , i didn &apos;t make it .
i swam with this thing .
it &apos;s the only one that i &apos;m interested in .
there are already today .
the manuscript can be a smartphone , or it could be a particularly special athlete , like today , many of these things , because they &apos;re not so much integrated .
many of you have a phillips direct life .
this is a more important part of our lives . we should sleep a third of our lives .
ok . let &apos;s go from sleep to disease .
so we can change the medicine in the world &apos;s age , in all ages , from the other ages , or generations of children to the seniors , the most remote spectrum of the disease -- i hope i &apos;m going to give you a sense of it -- around the globe .
so , i hope i &apos;ve convinced you -- the effects on the top of the world is enormous and the effects of diseases are also amazing in all these different diseases and more .
how do we make robust societies ? longevity .
and in the novel , a certain called a particular , a particular called a , and he says , maybe it &apos;s not the best way , and it &apos;s destroyed all the system .
and so no one would be there .
and she &apos;s a great thing .
so , five times , it should be faster .
maybe you ask yourself how to do this kind of thing .
our only cookbook of the world , in the fusiform , is the fusiform .
this is the finished hamburger , that &apos;s the finished hamburger .
a talk about surgical robots is also a talk about surgery .
and surgeons were more business than doctors .
but ultimately , the mid-ocean puppet is also the mid-ocean missile .
they had to give their intuitive movements to the instruments .
i &apos;ve told you about the great , complicated robot .
and as you see , how it comes out to do something useful , it can &apos;t stay there .
and we don &apos;t even have to be stored on this kind of thing .
we &apos;re here to talk about accidents .
but we had a problem .
okay , well , it was part of my fault .
we don &apos;t just showed that bacteria can be the solution to plastic plastic , but also that openness is to be able to take the most powerful and that &apos;s what allows you to do from risks .
the film we &apos;re going to see is made for the most of the time in new york .
i &apos;m not there .
it continued to go . they always tried to make things better .
they don &apos;t say , &quot; our style are curves . let &apos;s make the house off . &quot;
i think in my family , we have a lot of happiness . because we &apos;ve learned backwards .
and the way , very good !
ed : and then the row is a historical site , and there &apos;s a historical site in the world &apos;s history , which is the paris of the world , where the message has been .
you see this chair there ? the orange ? that &apos;s the most , the most , the chair .
because it &apos;s part of where we want to get .
it was the most devastating of the outrage , they were full of supernormal . they were a lot of the things . no solid information .
one of them is known : the population population . the world population is coming from two to almost seven billion people in the last 50 years .
brent ornish : so beautiful here to be .
you see the lines check up when the population population is happening .
before i talk about the cost of the cost , i have to hold very clear that i &apos;m very clear that i &apos;m very clear that i &apos;m very clear that
so liberation is actually from .
but only recently , we can , thanks to technical progress , now the quantum locking and quantum locking .
first of all , some strands of magnetic field is trapped inside , but the superconductor doesn &apos;t like it if you move , because your movements are using energy , and so the most powerful thing .
and that &apos;s what i can expand , of course , to make a broader label .
and it was inspired by this quote from maine adams . the situation is from &quot; by the reverse . &quot;
because of course , they don &apos;t explain how to do that when you want to do it , and no one has a more .
but even though they were not convinced they were , &quot; okay , we call it back . &quot;
and i &apos;m like , yes , i have .
so some of these will say , &quot; what &apos;s going to happen when moore &apos;s law is going to be in its borders ? &quot;
today you can buy half a billion . and they &apos;re even better because they &apos;re faster .
but where are we going to get the software ?
larry page has been held a passionate talk on our own system , which he was doing for this big challenges of humanity .
they wanted the fish .
that may be insignificant , but it &apos;s incredibly frightening , which is a lot of rumors that one more of the other things that have more than the last 13 o &apos;clock will come or maybe -- or maybe , or maybe ...
so the tsunami can be seen as a kind of conceptual moment , a moment where the blogosphere was going to be a lot of money .
and you probably have a lot of the number of the number of the number of the transplants in the glass , and it would be better than the estimate of 90 to 95 percent of them .
somebody has a little bit link , so we link other things , etc .
he finished his favorite , and i &apos;ll take a very special to put a heavy of paper with paper , but he just says , &quot; that &apos;s all i want to do from you . &quot;
so i &apos;ll show you a couple of seconds of film now , and i &apos;m going to show you the skin about the thing .
this habitat covered more the surface of the earth &apos;s surface .
many of us , i &apos;m locked , think that the exploitation of the oceans are only in the last 50 or maybe 100 years .
these about a cable are connected to our eyes and hands for work on the sea floor .
so there &apos;s a sling on this product that tells the computer exactly what the product is .
but i want to share with you some of my favorite discoveries of the census .
we don &apos;t know why they do that , we don &apos;t know .
this graph is based on a brand article that &apos;s going to appear in the journal of biology .
but that &apos;s not all of it .
as an architect , i have a little bit to prioritize .
mitchell ornish : don &apos;t build a house , they grow it !
i think that &apos;s very interesting , and very busy , because what you &apos;ve heard in the last few days is the sense of that , in different directions , directions , which are specific and unique for problems .
now , we all think that the most beautiful romantic poet was a big romantic poet , many of us forgot that he wrote some wonderful robe , and the most famous lectures is called &quot; an defense of poetry . &quot;
i &apos;m going to read that .
and to a certain time of his life , they &apos;re going to be on rocks .
but let me show you the latest entrepreneurial entrepreneurial .
if you used to , before the digital radio , the air shelf and &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of the most of the time is that you have two sources of information , which is the implications of food .
that means i have to predict about the future .
now , there &apos;s a very clear example where a of me feel a very different sense of feeling in a sense of the way when he was made from another person .
and in the meantime , i got two daughters .
so they didn &apos;t know the rules , after the other person playing .
if these dots were cars on a computer system , they wouldn &apos;t have any idea what &apos;s going on .
we &apos;ve shown that we can explain a big part of the data -- people actually plan their movements to the negative consequences of noise .
this is from the most of the world &apos;s ocean iv .
mars has the largest largest system of the solar system , the most remote .
this is my favorite . it was taken a few weeks ago .
the oldest stone on earth is only ritalin billion .
and the result of our meeting was a kind of a computer called pierpont .
we fold it , and we transport it in a spacecraft .
this is about a long time , oregon .
i think on the packaging , let &apos;s look at this -- &quot; eight to 12 . &quot;
and there was a guy who sold this weapons for lego because lego -- no , they &apos;re not on guns .
and then there are some examples of the stuff that are really sculptures .
i have to tell you , for me , for me , all of this evening .
perhaps most importantly , the impact on other companies is enormous .
in fact , politics is represented by the most of the time .
in brazil , there are now a facebook of the u.s. , whereas the united states only has 700 , and the two in california -- and within three years , the percentage of four percent is up to 85 percent .
this is not a really big thing . biofuels are really big thing .
scientists explain us -- and these are just estimates -- that we need to have to cut the energy of greenhouse gases , and that &apos;s how fast possible .
i can hardly wait what we &apos;re loving against the crisis of business .
there are still less people who are available to that , which you could get to be born , and then you get this classic of the curve and you get this classic curve .
b is on the edge of the network .
and that &apos;s what happens to each outer nodes .
the red dots will be the most , and the yellow dots will be friends of people with flu .
would you get conflicting to a little bit of a time ?
and there are , i think , three types of data that can be used to these of the data .
the building was in construction to collapse to collapse of the economy , and death of the &apos; 90s of the &apos; 90s .
although it seems to be a completely chaotic place , if you see it from top , there &apos;s a whole net of the world &apos;s whole web and channels that connect every single house .
in this tradition , the future is all the bride , all their cortisol , which are going to bring them to their new husband .
what a place like the spontaneous david is particularly remarkable , this kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of thing that people can do .
we can only ask : &quot; how hot the most important of the world &apos;s most , &quot; and what we want to ask is , or what we want to ask .
it &apos;s replaced by technology .
you can see on the left some symbols that show what &apos;s going on with his right arm .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re always getting older .
or even if we &apos;re getting much older , our cars can go to the way we can go to people .
they were gone in a moment .
it &apos;s always been more obvious that we can &apos;t win .
the two specialists behind the curtain will help me to bring the result on the screen .
one of the journalists asked , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
the yemeni ones are the same as jewish capture .
i think there are some , actually , many reasons , but there &apos;s just some of the things that we &apos;re going to focus on .
he was commissioned by the sink , he was leaving her , he was like a kind of a light for light , a little bit of a little bit .
let me go from door to the first community , and let me see if somebody is using it or troops for these are .
but for sergio , it was too late .
he saw her .
bertie power : a complicated hero about a complicated hero
this is what jobs and possibilities of all the whole things are .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about the almost food , because it was the last year , last year , last year , and 2008 , for every single one of the pieces of calories .
and i go into these stores when you &apos;re there , it &apos;s out of the fields to see what they can get , and i find it , you can &apos;t get food .
we see changes of participation in schools .
i want to talk about something that i call digital food .
and what i found is that instead of investing in subsidies and other things , they invest in a school program .
thank you .
we could do the same thing in cancer .
they &apos;re not going to go to a more of the time .
it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a device , not because it shows me how many of the people i &apos;m going to do every day , but because it &apos;s 24 hours long , which i do .
that &apos;s never shown .
the productivity of these magnets is so big that we can see this technology .
that you don &apos;t have to tear the tumor .
if the magnet is big enough , and their resolution up enough , they can actually be able to get all the proteins in the body and start to understand the individual system .
most of us find that , and interestingly , 12 vibrations are about a stop person &apos;s own one minute .
if i &apos;m going to go here -- -- longer than a few seconds , you would feel uncomfortable ; longer than a few minutes , and you would leave the room in the world .
that &apos;s all recognized . and that &apos;s the tune that &apos;s going to be in the world .
and i was there with two very good friends of mine , richard clooney and kevin .
while we cross miles and miles from the world &apos;s miles -- frozen , the most remote thing could be .
so as i stand here today , and you &apos;re talking to you , i went over the world &apos;s most little .
just 10 miles before the coast and in the middle of the hills , deep feet .
the ocean determine climate and weather , they hold the temperature stable and shapes the chemistry of the world .
and there are easy ...
this is the result if you don &apos;t know that there are borders for what we can take the oceans .
in the past three years , the united states has been good for example , as a result of the city .
we need the world &apos;s way to explore new technologies to explore the ocean .
and a lot of my early career i wanted to figure out how the wings of the insects generate enough power to keep themselves in the air .
let &apos;s study this idea of simplicity .
this is a beautiful picture of visual &apos;s visual , a mouse from jeff &apos;s lab , and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk .
they &apos;re a more complicated , to make some behavior , another more , another kind of thing , and you can think that this is a very complicated system .
our mission is to build a more sophisticated and realistic computer model of human brain .
he &apos;s home and drink tea .
if you see the surface of the neocortex , you &apos;re going to be able to be more louder , and it &apos;s a little bit of the components .
how many a type of a tree is there ? where are you running ?
we can look at the tissue . and we can change neurons .
we can log all these neurons , every single one in its own own own own own , and watch what happens .
and the other thing is , the secrets of the brain can be solved soon , mental illness , memory , perception , perception , and it &apos;s using them with a supercomputer that &apos;s going to be able to find the brain with the synapses .
it would be two or three thousand bombs .
the air force started building smaller models , and started this .
that &apos;s what nasa did to get a more of the time to fly to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about the behavior of the behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write . because there &apos;s so much resonance that you can get from people .
the bottom ? yellow .
if you ask people to ask these questions , think that it &apos;s something to do with the culture .
the countries on the right , those who give up a lot , have a slightly different form .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this .
but it &apos;s going back to get more complex .
a online pad for 59 dollars .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we really don &apos;t know that very well .
and in medical care , this is our view .
and radio waves are limited .
and so , you can just use the eye to protect the eyes with lower energy .
their intensity can be very fast , and they can be very quickly off .
they &apos;re critical critical , they are critical .
but that only by the way .
cars have a car and the other thing and you can communicate with each other and communicate through the water traffic lights with the cars and so on .
dna is what &apos;s going on all life .
because it &apos;s actually not so many data .
you have the genome , and the power of it is a human medicine that is better than today -- she has no side side side .
he &apos;s really simple -- just a mere , but we could completely disappoint him .
we &apos;re not running as a little organisms alone on the world , but are part of a big ecosystem .
the consequences can be bad -- if we split or the earth -- but that &apos;s just the consequence of one of us errors .
now i &apos;m mostly here because it &apos;s a kind of dig in the dog &apos;s right now at the moment that we have a page of people who think you &apos;re wearing a dog , first through the rules of rules , human rules .
they &apos;re just like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no , we &apos;re doing &quot; cloudburst , sit . &quot; -- boom , he can try to try to do it for six to 10 .
these are like golden , the golden .
and i would say , if you don &apos;t need it , it should not be .
not only with the coach , but also with the rest of the family .
these are so simple .
their children are just to train .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , and this windmill -- does it work ?
wk : yeah . i still think about working with energy .
because even though i used scientific terms in songs , it &apos;s sometimes very hard to let them sound .
and even less than it &apos;s accompanied by the most dramatic and the most more of the time in my case .
one is a white flash .
64 with 75 .
let &apos;s look at the third question .
the desert is spreading a mile or two per year .
the homo erectus asked the same tool about 30 generations .
you can teach you in the lab , a little bit more potent to practice . and there &apos;s actually a kind of a more of the other animals in the other animals , but the exchange of a object has never happened to be happening .
it &apos;s the wealth ; the pleasure of your needs , time to save time .
we &apos;ve reached this as species .
but there &apos;s no evidence for that .
and when people started to start , objects like this far , it was a clue that a exchange between groups existed .
but who knows how to make a mouse mouse ?
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m also about to be the connections that people go to , and that &apos;s not where they have the way to get the ideas to meet and to be too supportive , and i &apos;m sure that technology is going to continue to improve and improve the policy policy .
this is so high as a building , and i &apos;ve got the freedom of the freedom of the freedom .
but we don &apos;t talk about it , we don &apos;t take it seriously .
these are just gone , these feelings , they &apos;re gone .
if we think about the most of the time , the rapid development is usually the fast development , because how can we discover things that change all the time ?
i talked about that -- you know that situation , if you don &apos;t get a diagnosis in the hospital ?
what about real people ?
we were offering a part of their viruses ; it &apos;s new , long , a lot of the way .
after 10 more days with fever , she came back -- still a fever -- she &apos;s got a little bit of oxygen -- little oxygen in your lungs .
it wasn &apos;t even sequenced .
it &apos;s a classic assistant , but it &apos;s completely new . nobody has ever seen it before .
a huge battery could have this .
we &apos;re often arguing about something that fits to the most remote of the world &apos;s .
i brought a more of the lower density up with lower density , a high school with high density , and it &apos;s salt salt in between .
but david is young and smart and he wants a more , and so he builds -- he builds the first metal metal with this chemical composition .
so what do we learn from all of this ?
this video was taken in the most remote room . six kilometers before the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast .
fast , we realized that our garage was not big enough for this growing project .
i started to be interested in maria and her methods and how they found this , and how important they found that children are going to discover themselves , and they don &apos;t teach them to be a open type of a way to open a open type of art .
evolution often is considered this one way that we &apos;ve chosen , but it actually represents a big number of possibilities .
i &apos;m going to blow this up to the stage of space space .
our cities are risk of the coast of them , because many of you are in the coast .
there are stars and so forth .
so if we think about the behavior of the behavior or body body , how it &apos;s going to call the social scientists , then it turns around language . we think about communication .
this expression , also known as proud of jessica tracy , was studying that , in fact , that more people and from birth to blind people , that &apos;s when they win in a computer .
so i thought about it . you &apos;re holding on these people and see how they &apos;re involved in it . could you bring it to it and would be more involved ?
what happens to a computer of what happens when you get on the top stage ? how the following little manipulation , these tiny little , tiny of these tiny pieces ?
this is happening in the lab . the little exercise , for only a few minutes , can be a few minutes , where you can actually apply that ? that &apos;s what we &apos;re important .
these things . people are kind of showing me the true thing . you show yourself .
she was completely depressed and said , &quot; i don &apos;t have to look at this . &quot;
they need their bodies , privacy and two minutes . it can affect the other life in the big scale .
and the swimming swim to get to your own , and to get a ant , and the most , you get a ant , you get to the brain , and you go up a blade of grass like a jeep .
and you have to have a kind of a kind of a kind of kind of a kind of thing , you have to have a answer .
so it &apos;s like i think richard and i think that these ideas are not being abused .
and of course , they &apos;re actually extinct in the most dramatic .
but under all these ideas that are expanding very much in the world , many toxic ideas are .
and as viruses should not try and do it here , they &apos;re not trying to destroy them .
and in my game , it &apos;s called you .
we put some ideas on the legs , we went international on tour .
i know you &apos;ll say , &quot; t is not there . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
nobody hears each other . nobody &apos;s familiar with the other .
you &apos;ll see the orchestra in a kind of a mild device .
i don &apos;t want that to be that that should not have happened , but we need to be better if it &apos;s about answer the questions that you have to consider when you think about the consequences and the reactions .
they work in government government . they &apos;re driver .
five dollars can save life .
she deserves about two dollars a day , building a little bit of a time , and i explained that they don &apos;t have married to children before these things are done .
finally , from despair , they went and a way of old woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , if you &apos;re angry , you &apos;ll be able to keep the best talk you &apos;re ever going to regret .
okay , the great majority of us .
his message was basically unity , which is the connection of everything and the unit of everything . and his fundamental value was respect to strangers .
who are fighting , while he goes ?
they start to go to israel and palestine , in cambodia , in turkey , in syria .
and so more and more of the time , and it has been a income , and since recently she has a income to support their family .
just go to somebody with another culture , from another country , with another of the other , and it &apos;s kind of different and more sensitive to it . listen to him .
i &apos;m going to start where the story started , 1985 in 1985 .
now , before you get a lot of the way you had the opportunity to the shower ?
you see here -- 35 percent of these less famous houses , where 50,000 indigenous people live , 35 percent of the houses had a very similar shower .
21 percent of what we fix is the consequences of the world &apos;s consequences , things that were actually built around .
we did that . he was born .
we found out that in this region , the cause of disease and death is .
one thing is , in the context of everything we &apos;ve done , nelson mandela didn &apos;t say far from here , &quot; how slavery and transcendence is not intuitive . it &apos;s the work of people , &quot; it &apos;s the work of people , it &apos;s the work of people , it &apos;s the work of people , it &apos;s the work of people , it &apos;s the work of people , it &apos;s the work of people , it &apos;s the work of people , it &apos;s the work of people , it &apos;s the work of
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a little bit like you call me a computer . really not .
it really sounds like the top of this , and you &apos;re trying to use that , but if you &apos;re trying to use it , it &apos;s amazing effective .
and i &apos;m going to go to this statement , in the belief , that children should not leave their community to live in a better way .
this is the youngest of the biggest workforce in america with our most of our most of the bronx .
this is a picture of the mayor of the bronx , the kids in his house , not in prison , so they felt like it .
we gave something back .
if you &apos;re big kids with small kids , they are the big , thick man in the middle , which is cool , and they create responsibility under the world &apos;s worth of the most incredible .
now , you might wonder about these kids .
hold kids off these stores .
stephen moog : a teacher who &apos;s the south bronx
secondly , i bet that even you see that as a commodity , you see the difference here , a increase of the brain &apos;s .
to be 10 : put the pig a heart attack .
people with migraine migraine , which is a aura , have a band with nervous neurons -- here in red -- in red -- that &apos;s three to five millimeters per minute .
the problem is that 30 million americans have a migraine , and we need a more of the time , and i think we have now .
my first wish is that the most of the most , the most , is the most , the most , for epilepsy , for the most , for the treatment of the other -- a , in the treatment of other people &apos;s treatment .
lawyers take cases in the hope in the hope of the hope on the hope of germs that are the poor patients full of pity .
a year ago , four of five of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most
where do you know what &apos;s really important about that ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i have the first time to get it to this .
these people are calling me below the barrier , because they &apos;re really going to get out of the process , you know with the world .
they have to use engineering as a platform to develop their materials and they &apos;re doing the world &apos;s materials that teach teachers to teach teachers to teach the world .
yes , books , from which maybe 100 or 1,000 spending are sold in the year .
it &apos;s not surprising that it &apos;s all like that , right ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so that &apos;s not very hard .
the days of the most , the days , when people say , &quot; well , we &apos;d like to have three or a half of them in our country to see how that works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a more a kind of a life . it &apos;s a fashion project .
you can use some thousand children with two of the kids .
so it &apos;s like a electronic book .
everybody says that &apos;s a 100 dollars per gallon that can &apos;t do .
and that &apos;s the launch .
they click around things , stare at screens . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no . there &apos;s a better way . &quot;
we &apos;re all playing &quot; i love lucy &quot; on a big line , and we can &apos;t keep up .
thank you .
i think most people think that a hiv-positive mother , always her child &apos;s child .
that &apos;s not possible . it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s all good . they &apos;re going to live .
first , the most remote to prevent .
two years ago , one of the mentor mentor mothers came to me and told me a story .
how do you build a better health system ?
the most is the way that the system is just the system .
if you look at the volume of the gray substance in the age of four to 22 years , it takes it in childhood , which shows this graph . it &apos;s in the early youth .
the idea that your father in the public was singing , so they had to be a lot of the time .
this is the most important thing we built together .
after the first year , it was invited by the horror of the horror museum in austria to install it in his lobby and i &apos;m happy to say that there was online , 24 hours a day , for almost nine years .
but in the night , while we were , i asked the night , like the most , the way the most the world would have chosen , they would kiss sam .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place where my family has been working on four generations in the world &apos;s .
so , i &apos;m not sure what it has to do with a shepherd , but they &apos;re incredibly powerful .
the first thing you see in the world &apos;s most terrible is the terrible force of the world &apos;s .
he &apos;s going to take it to my leg , and i &apos;ll take back to a vehicle , and i can bring myself to a doctor .
it was a depression in the ground .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about them . &quot;
we &apos;ve been learning that 200 years of the end of our direct system are with the world .
so it &apos;s so simple to see technology as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect as technology .
it &apos;s the most of my favorite of my favorite .
i would like to think -- thank you .
and i can assure you : corn is all kinds of things .
they should know that in every community , the number of the world &apos;s number is already clear .
i led three of the things to antarctica .
but tell me where you &apos;re and what country they are . &quot;
we also studied the surface of the islands -- a very important kind of thing for birds , one of the most important things in the pacific .
and we &apos;re as the rest of the world in front of a problem .
he coined the term &quot; reverse review . &quot;
of course , the most , the open seas , and the open seas , but the most , the most , was looking at that , was in trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific , with huge amounts of water and huge .
now there &apos;s a lot of the immediate , immediate , automated , automated , free , for free , even on the smartphone .
it &apos;s an endless debate and there &apos;s no conclusions , no single answer to it , but if you &apos;re a geek like me , you say , &quot; well , what are the data telling us ? &quot;
instead , he &apos;s very carefully documented what happens again when technology is in a environment and in a community .
so there &apos;s , of course , two different ways .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a yves &apos;s painting .
i mean , that was at least how it was happy to me .
now , there was one question of course , which is a question that i &apos;m going to do in the head of a while , well , i can do more from the things that i like to do in design , and less of those who i don &apos;t like to do ?
and here &apos;s the front of it .
they &apos;re a terrible situation without the way to go .
they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it in hospitals .
as a result , for example , i was considered an extraordinary swedish in the world , because i knew the most popular thing , and i know how to use the most , and i know i can use the work of work .
i &apos;ve seen this value of older people in so many of my friends , who in their 60s , &apos; 70s , &apos; 80s , and &apos; 90s , and the &apos; 90s is still active than a , farmers and doctors .
as christian , and the most of the time , they were made of the most , and made of the most of the jewish men in the united states , and the american , and the abraham , who also goes back to the bible .
the case of the world &apos;s last muslim .
the biggest bad , the most bad , don &apos;t want these rocks to be the fruit . so he tries to prevent them on the most remote .
and one of my favorites is a literal picture of yemen .
&quot; and when is the article coming out ? &quot;
and the question is , it has to give you something that we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; &#93; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous if a group itself is being identified as extremely .
and the most of the time , the &quot; islam &quot; is singing superheroes .
let &apos;s look at it .
let me point it for you .
let me show you this .
and when i started designing something , i discovered something weird about myself .
so they have the eye and then they come to the concepts .
but of course china has a massive population .
but what that shows is that this kind of visualization is a form of information .
it &apos;s even a pleasure to deal with them , because they &apos;re visual .
the most is named the &quot; the eden project in britain . &quot;
why don &apos;t it smell like the bake or a more , and so there are two theories .
and a theory allows a less to work .
now after some months of the address , i discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule that &apos;s called a kind of molecule that &apos;s called a lot of the same .
this is the basis for the device that these two people have built from ford .
they made it ... and it &apos;s just like coumarin .
this was a good thing .
and the time is a series of things that i want to do .
and she actually didn &apos;t have any idea of the context where she was landed .
norman !
i didn &apos;t say nobody on goodbye , neither my mother , my father , my brother , my brother , my foster , my grandparents , my grandparents , no .
i reports to write about this . i hear that i just talk to you that i had two things when i left the seventh , which i wanted to do . that was my family to find poems and the other one was to write poems .
and this is how we look for them .
and then you hope that one of us are going to go out there and find small parts .
he had a kind of a more , and therefore , and that &apos;s why we have to be careful from other females , female and probably a lot smaller family family to achieve his age of 12 years .
is that a good evolutionary adaptation or will it lead to that we will be the creator of the world &apos;s best thing ?
but will we do that or will we take nature to their run ?
one day , a few weeks or maybe a year later , i was with my favorite school in a store for a store , and i wanted to buy a little bit of a sudden .
this meant a fundamental change for me .
my hint : about 70 layers of this , the most 70 of this , the most powerful .
you want to know how obsessed with me , i &apos;m really going to be ? this project is just for me , and yet i went to ebay , and i went to ebay .
when we &apos;re going to the way to the spectacular blue mountains in the west of sydney , it was a perfect , perfect , the smell of the world , and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you &apos;re ever going to walk again , just with a computer . &quot;
i remember that my father has climbed me out in the wheelchair , and i was up to the top of the top , and i felt the sun on my face .
they said , &quot; we &apos;ll be able to put you next to you , because we think that &apos;s good for you . &quot;
she was going to put me on the phone phone and i called the school school , i said , i &apos;d like to be a book book .
and i said , &quot; the &quot; &quot;
and mom and daddy ? were never up up .
i &apos;m in this world , but i &apos;m working in the world .
it &apos;s like a kind of a computer &apos;s being flying by a richard serra .
how do i do a telephone in three weeks , if i have this stuff , that &apos;s developed over millions of years ?
each of these elements could be on the wall as a kind of loss of loss .
in his days , he was the highest injured in british .
i look at individual , and how they flow -- how they expand and flow . it &apos;s based on furniture , but that &apos;s not the most devastating thing . it was made from aluminum , as opposed to the aluminum and it &apos;s grown .
this is the car of the future . it &apos;s a water water .
if you &apos;re next to contemporary architecture , it feels completely of me .
this is my studio . it &apos;s underground .
it was made from excess acne .
and so after i did my dr. , i had a lucky , member of a computer , which used to be used to the first time to explore the ocean .
there was one of these most of the most powerful .
he uses red bioluminescence like a computer system to be a more of the animals that are blind to the red light , and you can see it without being seen .
so they use it to eat and find partners .
i challenge you to call another science that &apos;s still used hundreds of years old .
this is a magical place .
so i made myself the value of sleep .
and at june , i heard a loud bang in 1995 , which was my life changed and finished the duck .
and here &apos;s the duck .
after the price changed , my life changed .
another example of the effects of the effects of the birds on the life of birds .
so , if i &apos;m like something -- this is the sound for purple .
depending on how i &apos;m going to hear it , i can hear the food music and i call it .
one of them is &quot; i have a dream &quot; by martin luther king , and the other is from hitler .
now , you can see more often , that former health is now the most more than the most important .
you don &apos;t want to say anything about it , which could be used against one . &quot;
absolutely critical .
and what happens when teachers want to be fine ?
and why not ? you don &apos;t trust the law . why don &apos;t you trust the law ?
because it &apos;s so that freedom is a structure of structure .
because life is complex , and here &apos;s the hardest and biggest change : we need to have the authority for the interpretation and application of law and the officer .
a free society needs red and green lights , otherwise it &apos;s going to be completely mild .
it &apos;s the limits of the interest , the most remote , and the most remote thing that you can take .
well , if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard to be a little bit more difficult to do with a ruler .
he had a very bad job .
he had just a more of the time .
but the problem , on rules , is to leave the way that they &apos;re going to be able to put the professional activity . and they &apos;re burning the professional activity in two ways .
so smart , so , are better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that some smart people can get this for unlimited time .
why has this idea spread ?
people want to be a lot of things .
it was a remarkable time . i &apos;m going to be a little bit more closely , which we -- america and the rest of the world -- then .
this was a lot of the turtle , the turtle .
we have to do it with a full of a complete .
what i want to show you is what you need to transport 34 pounds up to the more powerful uranium .
what would have been if you had nuclear weapons ?
we come down and bring the truck that you saw right here , somewhere here in the world .
part of the problem is that the most devastating self is overwhelmed with a nuclear disaster .
it was sent to me from somebody who &apos;s a computer of the most , a computer of the world &apos;s fact , that it was difficult to be america .
there are many black sheep out there , which is done the wrong things , and the problems have still been touched .
we can show our results . we can make things better .
how can we tap them ?
it &apos;s a dangerous working approach to have a dangerous working project .
imagine , we could , because if we could , we could achieve more .
governments who are most progress , are governments who have found ways , &quot; shared value in business , rather value , &quot; instead of seeing the the actor that &apos;s saying the informal .
maybe i can cut this up here , and i can see the brain , and i can change my cut .
i want to zoom out .
come on to me a moment with me in the 19th century , right to 24 jazeera .
we could certainly be so productive if facebook or twitter wouldn &apos;t cost us so much time .
they &apos;re going to give up the british government to get money for the building of babbage , because they believed that these machines would have tremendous practical implications for society .
these benefits didn &apos;t just made less wealthy men that research research , but they also were upset , to look at the most , rather than answer .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i learned something about life .
if you start looking at the very small things , this person has written a whole article and said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and all the ones that are not old enough , they don &apos;t have any idea how this infection happened -- which is by these souls .
there are about 10,000 programs .
this would be the frequency in which you can find every 26 letters of the pad in a picture of the .
everywhere life is , you will have these distribution , unlike that distribution .
too hot , too hot to hot , too hot to hot .
the officer asks , &quot; are you sure ? hey buddy , are you sure you &apos;ve lost this ? &quot;
these are the data of a single survey to the only district in zambia , from a few years ago , which i &apos;ve got .
as you see , bruce cox then had a lot more hair .
you could talk about 10,000 , 20,000 or 30,000 dollars , if i had the time or it &apos;s been transformed in my plan , and i don &apos;t just have in vacation .
instead of teaching people how to put the forms on the cell phones , we should develop software that allows you to do that , without practice and without my favorite .
that &apos;s less than i made , when i went to two weeks , when i went to two weeks .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , in life or the balloon , we need to change the height .
that can be in the spirituality .
and that &apos;s why you need weather weather .
i promised me that i would take the next time i would fly around the world , not a fuel , regardless of fossil fuels to be safe , not by the most dramatic .
i think you need a pilot in the plane , which can talk to the universities , who can talk to students , with politicians during the flight , and it really can make a human adventure .
and what is the goal ?
this is why all people who believe that in this spirit are welcome to being part of this team .
now you just need a laptop .
anyway , for us , africa was a magical place .
the next thing i want to make clarity is what this problem is and what it is not .
that &apos;s crazy , really , if you think about it .
let &apos;s stop a second with the nonsense .
the fact is that we &apos;re the first generation , the disease , and this extreme poverty can see in the eyes , you see it , and you &apos;re not going to be , and it &apos;s not going to be .
it &apos;s a nerves .
this year is a test for us , especially for the leaders of the bloggers , who are starting to be able to look at the world .
people find that slowly .
and with this one campaign as our screen , my organization , data , and other groups , the energy and the enthusiasm out there from hollywood to the south of hollywood .
step step forward , you go forward , a nurse , a teacher , a a a big , and life will be saved .
the idea that the internet is changing all their lives , a country can change -- and a continent of it just made it analog , because of the head of digital -- i &apos;m going to see the head .
lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
now , their job is to see what this shapes is and what kiki .
now , if you &apos;re not just going to be a little bit of it , this sentence is literally , wrong .
if we solve a problem or something new , we compare that what we already know , with what &apos;s unknown to us .
tamara jal : i &apos;m glad to be here .
they don &apos;t fit all these representations .
pm : i don &apos;t think that .
how are they doing it , and they &apos;re personally , but with their own own ?
some of my reporters are arrested .
this is quite clear a different picture of yemen .
my heart was three times too big .
this is a list of side effects : if you eat too much salt like a , and a little bit of sandwich , you probably land on the care of intensive care .
but soon , i showed symptoms for the most , and i had to go back to the most remote , knowledge , i would never see my home again .
i was sitting there and talked little excited about the computer of the transplants and asked him what i needed when i needed a transplant , to prepare me .
i was going to have a dozen machines that thought i thought was alive .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these is a kind of a kind of a lot of the u.s. in the u.s.
also , it &apos;s interesting that the same business , that &apos;s the 80 million pounds of atrazine , is the antidote to the antidote , and the same company .
we also launched as a more of the time .
what would our generations tell us when you &apos;re next to a child , and i had a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a coach a. , and a little bit of a coach a. a. .
the problem is that you &apos;re in my village , oakland , in most of our villages , that &apos;s not what we see .
here &apos;s what you see in the front of the world &apos;s seat , next to the airport of los angeles .
i offered five cents for every single one of the most .
the most , the most , can &apos;t be caring , it &apos;s become global .
here you see , in red , the spread of the world &apos;s spread .
they &apos;re like a mouse that looks at the foot of a elephant , and the largest part of you remains hidden .
you look out of your tree and you get out of all directions around us .
redwoods have a huge surface that fit into heaven because they tend to be something called what &apos;s called the most , what you call .
and the redwood of stability , the redwood stability , just like a cathedral , and help the tree , longer to live .
it &apos;s absolutely a lot of the time to see that .
but since recently , all the doors of the palace are going to break up and break the walls .
this was 25 years ago .
so let &apos;s take a look at the first time for example .
how do these people do with these infected computers ?
and you can afford to see how we work -- how security works -- and try to find a way to find the most , which we meet .
you &apos;ll see that you can see a little bit of a little bit of a time , and you can see , the d / d , and if you open this image on your computer , this program is downloaded and done .
and if you look at the images of the scene , you can see that the siege of the patriot is .
we need to find any way to make sure that everything is going to be playing , even though the computer is going .
but i don &apos;t have to do anything .
this person around the world .
why should we think what he says ? &quot;
how does his future look ?
these forces disappear completely , no one &apos;s the most , in 2011 .
it would be good if people were a little bit of the time , and that kind of calculations would take seriously and they would be involved in that , because this would change things . but it would change things on two more .
that means we see a copy even if you just use one part of the most of the most remote , and it &apos;s a bad amount of the world &apos;s moving and a worse and more likely .
and the happy few , jill and kevin ? well , they came back from their favorite and saw that their video had been spreading as a kind of a computer .
thank you !
you &apos;re going to go into the distance .
this is what was taught to do , since he was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had a mentor like a supercomputer who taught me how to do it .
what is it that &apos;s going to be in life today ? not 10 years ago .
what do you do with what you &apos;re doing , and it &apos;s going to happen ?
didn &apos;t have the -- time . had no one -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager . didn &apos;t ...
in this moment , , or the unconscious , in the moment you &apos;re deciding , you can focus on something , you can make a meaning and whatever it means , it makes feelings .
have ever been done , and they &apos;re then , &quot; that was me ! &quot;
to death , you &apos;re bored in his infinite wisdom , and we had another human need : the uncertainty .
but that &apos;s true : we need it . we can do it through intimacy , through friendship , through prayers , through the expense of nature .
and there are seven different beliefs . i can &apos;t go through it because i &apos;m through . the last element is feeling .
jewish man with family in the stairwell , someone in new york , who would died if he had been at work at the work , and this man , who wanted to be a bloody and clear it .
instead , i &apos;m interested in developing tools , which can tell a big number of people to tell their stories everywhere .
the color of the particles is the kind of feeling -- happy , positive feelings have shining colors .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was the whole day . &quot;
and when i go over here , the list starts walking on , and there are thousands of feelings that were collected .
the 10 themes of radiation and circle the time .
it &apos;s called &quot; universe : unveiling our modern mythology . &quot;
we can click this and see this monthly picture of the alliance of the sinclair ford , like you were doing the counter of her husband .
you can also look at quotes if you like to read quotes to climate change .
so people feel clouds as something that is in ways .
in life , they &apos;ve been in nearly 100 million countries in almost 100 countries .
they just need a step outside to go out , and to notice that , so common , so common , that all other people are missing it .
so look up , admire the equivalent beauty , and think about it , and you &apos;re always thinking about the head in the clouds .
the 25,000 shots would have been made that they had done , &quot; the &quot; , &quot; well , good , good .
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the most , to buy my first favorite . it was a huge machine .
these shots come from a virtual employer .
here you can see how the knife is being donated to the heart .
it &apos;s a little , mechanical pen , which has been built in his inner very , very fast ancestor .
this is a really interesting project now .
so he does .
so , very talented people .
i went to the kids as often as possible to get out of the academic stuff with the real world in connection .
it &apos;s not all that it &apos;s not all , but it &apos;s an incredibly powerful summary of everything we know about nature .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details why we think that the universe is so , but it makes the mathematics and trying to explain physics that we know .
but over my career , it &apos;s always a little bit of me .
in 2001 , i visited them during a computer .
we got many of the results .
this is the first degree of the first degree in 2004 .
he &apos;s a short degree of the most optimistic and recently shot with someone who you all know .
every one is going to have a slave of a slave , but in different scientific disciplines .
i have my first computer as a teenager in bolivia and it was a really great device .
he &apos;s exploring the brain using mri and he said that this is the most beautiful brain that he ever had to have .
and the next few slides i &apos;ll tell you about this .
transistors are going to be smaller to allow that and that &apos;s what our technology did much better .
our favorite system is behind this lens .
i had a brain attack that we &apos;re wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so we know what a radius is .
i like to call it the most of the most important of the world &apos;s most , because they &apos;re kind of a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of thing .
we can see more detail in our galaxy than somewhere else .
and that brings us a factor of 20th .
so there was a bunch of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff there .
it &apos;s a lot more powerful than the other and the cloud is going to be fed apart .
and i hope i &apos;ve convinced you that we have a really supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy .
one day i was in the streets of new york and saw some kids between the bottom , cars and fire baseball .
so for example , people liked the age of the age of the age that ended up .
in the first eight centuries of this tradition , the big thing was , &quot; what &apos;s &quot; what &quot; god , &quot; god to appreciate and prices .
through new and improved instruments , the age of the yemeni is .
but one question is , what happens when the music stops ?
michael : music and feelings in the course of time .
so we &apos;re at the beginning of a new world .
until the year , they brought it to 100,000 year .
so i &apos;m going to talk about the most of the time , although i don &apos;t know where i &apos;m going to start .
wow , a volunteer , great !
but recently , my interest was to look at a new view of a new view of the world , because there are circumstances where these things can really make cool .
well , i think this is the latest development of a phenomenon that we call &quot; aluminum innovation . &quot;
but the element of excitement is really the most important .
we get amazing talk from you .
let me introduce you to this point sam .
but even if you &apos;re going to get the screen , there &apos;s a lot more than just words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
as a result of global innovation , innovation is improving .
first , i have to take a translator to the audience , and i &apos;m going to talk about what i &apos;m going to give you instead of saying , instead of saying what i can &apos;t offer .
and that they &apos;re fun to design their own ultimate or worst tedtalk .
well , you can &apos;t compare them to each other .
they hold them on life and give them the sugar , so a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a thing we call .
this kind of tests is used to do this , ok ?
somebody asked &quot; why ? &quot;
the thought he could reverse the waves . he couldn &apos;t .
i think there are three big changes , and that &apos;s where transparency and accountability , where people have a real power .
how do we do that ?
my favorite , sharon , said , &quot; the whole world exist more photos of your head as from every other .
11 of 14 countries .
and secondly , teachers looked at the most , and they were a creative way to be a creative tool , because they took a specific form of the way that a computer sense is .
so i wish all of a nice weekend .
dna to read and write , will always be easier and cheaper .
and the other thing is work alone .
now , you might ask yourself , &quot; what would i do in a computer ? &quot;
if you have this whole world , it can lead to a computer system , which is allowed to do biotechnology .
the kingdom said , his laws allow him to make strangers , or the most powerful risk , or a risk of health , or a risk of health care or the values of the state .
these laws are a blow into the face for science and the ignorance of the welfare and ignorance and a more potent from traditions and a selective .
why are you going to be pregnant when you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of 10 thousand people who inject drugs .
so that social social worker , the condoms are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be called or randomly .
here were children born there , people died there .
office for personal work are now obsolete .
they &apos;ve gone up the high line , the street , the river , the river below the street , and you come from a end of the end to the other , without cross the most , without cross the most , without cross the most , the most remote .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny apartments . &quot;
also , jobs should be shared .
your liver makes oil .
and they killed the 12,000 sharks at the time by actually putting a more of the most , in the bay bay in the bay bay .
we know very little about them .
so this tag is finding the place of a shark , depending on time and sunset , the water and deep .
let &apos;s look at the scarf , which has what to do with the genes that are passed from the parents , then we see that basking sharks , compared to the first study , a to the factor 10 less diversity than others .
so , the way that we were doing is that the size of this research and found out that the size is the size of the 9,000 .
and what was okay . we were wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build . &quot;
so if we can see the gender of the shark , before we take a sample , we can say the geneticists , whether they were from a male or female .
so i decided to give myself the most the the most recent .
their bodies are going to be broken with the most remote and they &apos;re being used for any of the most , to make money -- people tell a lot of these stories .
no business with no business .
my journalism may not fit on other continents or in other countries , in my part of africa , but it &apos;s about corruption , and it &apos;s about corruption , who are the evidence ?
aa thank you .
i was raised in downtown manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks away from the most remote of the world &apos;s .
i wouldn &apos;t read as a child .
and had these people ever met a victim of their favorite ?
today , you can be in 29 states , more than half of the country , because of his sexuality &apos;s host .
i &apos;m wondering that my mission was &quot; silent to photograph , &quot; because there was a million different types of gay .
at least i hope that it &apos;s harder to be more difficult to be human rights .
first , the world is , and it &apos;s always good and evil , because good and evil , yin and yang are the most important .
and third , i had access to all the 1,000 images that had made soldiers .
on three ways , the conventional way is called the conventional way .
this is stanley harris , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he said , &quot; could the holocaust happen , here and now ? &quot;
&quot; my lord , who is responsible when it happens to him ? &quot;
stanley harris and i closed the high school , and the one of the high school in the bronx , the james &apos;s in the bronx .
here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
the other thing . the other thing .
alexander &apos;s name says that the border between good and evil through the heart of a human being .
and i &apos;ve been carrying the experiment next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what everybody could do , &quot; no big thing to jump on the tracks .
it &apos;s a mystery that was really hard to make .
we have a self .
but on my left , a lot of a sudden is a more of which is distributed by the red arrow .
there &apos;s only one reference , which is the body .
i promise that i &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s supposed to be a clue .
and the limbic self has extended memory , thinking , imagination and language .
thank you . thank you for the sleeping table -- and the hill .
now i &apos;m telling you this -- i tell you , and i &apos;m going to tell you , i &apos;m ridiculous , because i think feminism has partly the task , and the aesthetics , and beauty and beauty .
we don &apos;t want a hero .
you can see , i don &apos;t have to put myself in brand .
they talked about the most of them , they started to be organized , they &apos;re organized , they &apos;re going to be friends -- all these everyday actions of care and creativity .
i mean that this is the creation that the homo sapiens of earlier the former sapiens of earlier .
in fact , this is a sensor for brainwaves , which reads the electric activity in my brain while i think this talk .
we &apos;re a lot of prototypes and products to live with the thoughts that you can control with thoughts like eisenhower , or a floating chair .
the headset is wireless with a ipad or a smartphone .
as these kids can use their new consciousness to their recovery , many of the smartest and the social social systems are turning to the people who are diagnosed with the other than a different being diagnosed with .
they understood the power of human narrative and that the value we &apos;re doing on people , changes , changes and growing .
and said , &quot; how are you going to celebrate ? &quot;
my skills and my possibilities .
temporary , and very unexpected , they gave them .
this is not what this is thought of , my eyes .
i went to a track that i know good .
and very slowly , it happened .
i didn &apos;t really believe i was not really thinking , not really , not all the details of me , all the little ones in all of us .
i &apos;m . my whole i .
what we have is exactly the same thing that &apos;s the same activity , but in one of them , they feel great , and in the other , with only one small change in attitude , they feel terrible .
but i think it &apos;s another debate that needs to be the place that &apos;s going to be about control , which we have about our tax data .
for the cost of the money , you could have been able to install the trains in the trains , which is not the duration of the journey , but what the pleasure and the the thing would have improved is more improved .
i &apos;m not asking the full dopamine of the one about the other .
sometimes the lines are very , very long .
i think the danger in the world is that the field of economics is going to understand the field of economics as a human psychology .
the average answer to 50 to 60 percent .
it will be you , you &apos;re not going to be able to hurt yourself , even other .
yay !
they &apos;re 20 , 30 years .
but that didn &apos;t mean i have a coin with a head on both sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but that &apos;s our skin &apos;s skin .
thank you .
with hyperscore , we had a lot of good effects in children in the world , and now people in the world are every age of every age .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful , which wants to live forever .
hello . my name is dan &apos;s . i &apos;m 34 years old , and i have foundations .
this is actually the score of dan &apos;s numbers that he wrote completely in hyperscore .
odysseus said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do a more of the time .
there &apos;s first time that the present self .
i have to write five pages a day for articles , or i had to give five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that this is going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you is the last of the last time , is something i created with hal , who was struck me from my co-author at a previous project bill .
it &apos;s pretty good that it &apos;s not about people , because if one of the faces smiles , the other face is going to look at the other face .
this is one of the reasons that so much of what we &apos;re doing for western science , math and the most remote , actually in the first few centuries of our most of the world &apos;s most , and developed .
x is the unknown , because it &apos;s not a &quot; sh . &quot;
so it &apos;s not that if you talk about mental illness , you probably have stories of the most of the time , shame and discrimination in almost all the life lines .
something more than 30 years ago , the nations of the world were given in the world in the world and gave these sticky explanation .
what is it ?
if you look at the level of species , you &apos;ve heard about the fish .
you see this profit , you see that almost 8,000 of these dollars are actually subsidies .
that was in the early stages , when india wanted to be driving his own , as a tool to the most , to china , after the age of eight , nine , 10 percent , 10 percent , and , why can &apos;t we see that ?
it &apos;s not going to be happy to do it , but they have trust and the courage , and to say , &quot; we &apos;ve been measuring .
green carbon , so the emissions through deforestation and agriculture , and blue carbon , and blue carbon together are 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it to win .
i didn &apos;t know what these things are doing , dick also doesn &apos;t -- sydney , by the way .
i also liked this intellectual system .
and he said he had basically the same relationship to his father .
there was a theory .
he did it again .
they &apos;re not moving , and because they don &apos;t move in the course of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed all the whole things , and the most powerful color , which is just fantastic to the very fantastic aluminum .
many of these ideas are producing fins in the trailer for airstream .
if you think about it , your children are going to send the death of the tinkering school , they &apos;re going to come back with the most remote , and they get back .
but let &apos;s take you to your own conditions , and you &apos;re trust , you &apos;re going to learn things that you can &apos;t learn from the most of the world &apos;s .
if you want to throw a device back , you don &apos;t do it .
i think that &apos;s all . this is number five . okay .
so here you see the sick knee on the left , and here my wife &apos;s going to go to the walk today , four months after , in aspen , and in good constitution .
how about a completely more of the most remote , not just sharing the parts ?
this is one of the seven times more existing , which is not been shot in all of the time .
and so , in fact , it was the western world , and it started to buy a lot of western europe , and then hundreds of thousands and then millions of individual , small paper , to print a in the middle of the hell .
but how does our imagination work ?
but we never think about the hidden connections .
as edison the light bulb invented , she looked like this .
you have to be quite smart , and even though i don &apos;t have college , it doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m stupid , because you can &apos;t be stupid today , and it &apos;s going to get a lot of it in the world .
they literally have the door of the door .
if you listen to the most of your favorite , you hear both of your ears both the speakers .
we have the problem that the antenna are expanding .
again , thank you .
i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and the most interested in systems .
i &apos;ve been created some pretty sophisticated types of sophisticated fever .
and i drew your own special card , and i wrote her name on it , and she wrote her , and send them to her .
i &apos;m sure i can see how you &apos;re going to be .
and i &apos;m convinced that it &apos;s a lot of the time , my valuable and limited life on this earth .
in this mode , he tries to keep his position .
i thought i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about how nature creates materials .
we think about future technologies . we start to start with the world &apos;s beginning .
and if you look at it , you see the amino acids with the most remote , which you have different charges .
and by a sequence of a series of the world , you can see one of a billion fish , which is what you want to do , like a battery or a solar cell .
in this case , you see the way that you get out of it .
if you ask people , where do you go to the question , if you have something important ?
i sat on my desk , i &apos;ve used my expensive computer .
what happens -- sometimes you have these days , you wake up eight o &apos;clock in the morning , or when you stand up , and you &apos;re going to say , man , i don &apos;t have good sleep .
in the office , most of the sixth-graders are the sixth-graders , and distractions that people actually stop from work .
we all know that it &apos;s true . they would never experience a spontaneous meeting that from employees .
meetings and managers are now the two main problems in companies , especially in offices .
maybe two weeks , or every week , the week , the week , the one who can &apos;t talk to you .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m doing this now seven years and no idea how the future is going to look .
but if you ask people to ask the three most important things they &apos;re wearing , whatever culture , which is gender and what the relationship -- most people , and if they have one , the mobile phone , and if they have one , the mobile phone , and if they have one , the mobile phone , and if they have one , the mobile phone , and if you have one , the mobile phone , and if you have one , the mobile phone , and if you have one , the mobile phone ,
but , and this is a very big but we have the tendency to forget .
now , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
they take 10 or 20 percent of the time , and then the owner of the church takes 10 or 20 percent of the time , and there &apos;s the rest of the rest of my family .
it &apos;s the norm .
and he somehow has a recognition for the values of the line .
at the same time , we see this mobile devices , we see a expectation of availability .
our present reality is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell later about .
what are we talking about ?
dean ornish shares us new research , which shows how the wooden the wooden depression can affect a human level of genetic level , and he says , if we live healthier , we &apos;re going to eat better , and more , we &apos;re going to be able to reproduce , and we &apos;re actually loving our brain cells .
until i tell you who said it .
within this context , we can feel regret about many different things .
when i went home , after i got my tattoo , i stayed almost the whole night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s another fifth .
i mean , even the stupid answer to all of us can let us go back to the days of days .
and as i said , i &apos;m a kind of a computer .
i thought i would try to try to do my ted wish to try to do what i &apos;m trying to do , and how to fit this , what they &apos;re trying to do .
no india in india . now , at least one million active .
and i came up with the idea that someone in this whole world must think about the organization of the world &apos;s organization .
and so we did that , to do that .
listen to that : less than four tenth of a digital percent of the weight that were treated , the ability to be stopped , and the way their treatment is in the way .
it &apos;s a try and i think it would be successful .
the grim ones are not free .
if the horn is used , it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity , and night .
and people bring their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , with green school .
local women from bali cooking cooking , the food on the top and they use secrets that only know their grandmothers .
we need somebody who comes and studied that .
the green school is a model that we built for the world .
my tongue , voice and vocal vocal , and they were not stuck . &quot;
then apple alex made the best voice i heard .
there was a reason for that : that was me .
the most of the time is not of course .
but it &apos;s not about it .
at the beginning , the internet was a tool for me , now it &apos;s something that i &apos;m going to leave for my real , daily life .
it &apos;s human being to ignore disease .
they all know the test for artificial intelligence , the record .
before i was an architect , and my grandmother asked me , &quot; what do you live ? &quot;
we treat two of the pages of the pages as a single side , because it &apos;s the readers .
so what is the lesson behind ?
but one day , my grandmother said , &quot; no , you &apos;re going to go to it .
it &apos;s been done and terrible things with me .
all lost hope in my healing .
so they went to their own and all of their own furniture -- they gave me a fool and they gave me a lot of the time , and i was going to be a lot of the time .
you don &apos;t know how far this road is , and you don &apos;t know if they go straight and they &apos;re hearing cars and they have a terrible accident , and they had a terrible accident that they &apos;ve got in these capable .
i thought that some reason that there was a time , and only for family and friends , was raised .
for example , the understanding of molecular structures .
he took me to the most remote of the world &apos;s most .
can we say we &apos;ve all discovered the symmetries of the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t turn it , because i &apos;ve built a little bit of a barrier , right ?
if i move a magic train , and then another one makes it a third .
galois has set a series of laws to how these tables , these symmetries , interact .
one such symmetry we call it a lot of symmetry .
instead , all the mess , i want to know how many digits have the number . ok ?
i need your final book . symmetrical objects basically have -- please whistle him for me .
first of all , worse diet , maybe shorter .
thomas edison had been very much in software software today .
penicillin was discovered by the world , but even in the royal , not a commercial and medical useful range of it .
it was the origin of the world &apos;s origin , the last year his 50th birthday .
for me , the lesson of unintended consequences is that chaos is now happening . let &apos;s do the best one .
works in every computer and browser . minus , minus , minus and the text is going to be smaller .
it doesn &apos;t need to be able to delete extra .
and so , a kind of information that i &apos;m inspired to inspire me , my real desk .
a means about it would be like a kind of a kind of a , so that you get the more traditional desktop . the things are in grid .
now i &apos;m going to get the heart of the people and there &apos;s no boundaries anymore .
but i think the point is , it &apos;s metaphors with bite , and with such a bite , i want to suggest that we &apos;re going to suggest the role of contemporary mathematics , not just , but mathematics in general .
and he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s 2,000 physicists at wall street and i &apos;m one of them . &quot;
you can find them here : this is a book about flies that may have been on amazon .
these are not a more of the time ; that &apos;s culture .
you can do it very , very far .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s actually so interesting .
go . shake . louder !
i want to tell you a secret .
so , , in fact , , without traffic lights , so with stop , many lives , but there &apos;s a catastrophic faster from them .
the answer is to allow cars to get safe from this side of the road .
warren haidt had recommend this : frankly , what works and what &apos;s not and to make it a annual thing .
in fact , we see the genetic , that it &apos;s the only known disease because of the world in africa , even several things have been formed to get the most different thing to do .
this means that the economy in these areas are drawn to these areas because it just prevents so much .
but there &apos;s no more a more of us .
not only was she weak ; she &apos;s going to be able to get it .
a teacher of the top is going to be the performance of his class -- measured in a year for 10 percent .
but it &apos;s not a relationship to be a better teacher .
&quot; what happens here ? &quot;
and this free courses could not be available in the internet , but you can also make dvds everywhere , so everyone with access to a more of the teachers can have the best teachers .
traditional vessels , like this cup , need eight to 10 hours to burn .
the sculptor richard serra talks about how he thought as a young artist , he was a painter and he lived after his school school .
when i look at these photographs , i &apos;m going to go back to my clothes , and i went home to my family .
my parents were great . they said , &quot; we know that you &apos;ve scared , but let &apos;s just go tomorrow .
but is it so bad to keep us for that powerful ?
this is a half of the general general in boston .
the translator takes the sample , and it &apos;s a , it &apos;s a , i think , it &apos;s under the microscope and then informed the operating room .
so in this kind of kind of , a solution to these adolescents , with these teenage molecules , with a sunny , green , is shown in the world &apos;s own , and the normal tissue can &apos;t separate these molecules .
with the other of our own lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph nodes , the lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph nodes begins .
if nerves are damaged , they can cause satellite , and pain .
if we &apos;re these two samples of water ...
we know that this is doable and we &apos;re determined to realize this .
and this cell is one of the thousands of different types of different people we learn .
it will affect the healthy circuits as the sick , which you want to fix .
and one morning in the summer of 2004 , we tried it and it &apos;s been working on the first time .
we &apos;ve shown that already a short record of this cells is going to be able to make that .
and it &apos;s going . now .
i want to end with a story of the story we might think it might be clinical application .
now you can see that the animal actually is the walls and the little platform , and it can use its eyes again .
buildings are a marketer in the air , and the water is the water that &apos;s filled with the window and over mechanical .
and if you stop out , the air contains microbes that are associated with the most general and the container .
obviously , i &apos;m a physical person , as you see , so i didn &apos;t worry about this thing , that thing is going to be a lot of blocks .
the same thing is true for the question , who was in the streets of september september in my neighborhood ?
and you can get a list .
one of these things i &apos;ve been experimenting with is something called google share , basically , you take a abstract term and search in google after that , and then you look at this results of someone .
this is a star rush . i mean , ok , interesting .
if you have the second side here , you link a most .
what &apos;s normal for us to do 40 years ago -- that &apos;s what stories between generations -- now , rarely .
it turned out in 1939 , the film is older than most grandparents of our members .
was the story told me good ?
why do we see that not with the same passion like reading ?
in california , they &apos;re going to send them to a pop , &quot; this product contains chemicals , which is the state of california as a cause of cancer , &quot; and other people are going to be seen . &quot;
so maybe we could develop a more of the way that humility requires . and for my profession as an architect , it &apos;s a conscious thing that the words &quot; humility &quot; has been mentioned .
i don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was , &quot; the stone stone didn &apos;t start because of the rocks . &quot;
and that can be designed for berlin , but we were building in manchester , and all the windows are closed . and with all the products that are obviously designed for the use of the use of the use of the use of it , that &apos;s actually a vertical .
if we look at the word competition , i &apos;m sure most of you use it .
since we &apos;ve been taken the 4,000 most of the most common , most of the most common most common in a database that we &apos;re going to put in six weeks of public .
now we have 160 pounds of heavy misery that are learning in the internet .
we started to use commercial and mixed using buildings so that all people have centers and places where they can stop .
and this is the most important thing that &apos;s the most important thing in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . let &apos;s tell you about none that we knew that all of us knew that we knew it .
for example , they &apos;re going to start that the most , in microsoft at 9 / 11 2007 , started in yahoo 2008 , and then the other : google , facebook , facebook , apple , apple , apple and so on .
i chose sweden because sweden is similar laws , like the united states .
and who also tells you , he didn &apos;t have to hide it for a long time .
their email were read and they talked to the most , and she said , &quot; if there &apos;s no right on privacy , it can &apos;t give you a real perspective , and therefore not effective democracy . &quot;
many people , if you see a fresh human brain , say , &quot; normally it looks different when you get a brain . &quot;
all these empty areas , the areas that are moving through the phone .
and the nature of a particular cell , and it &apos;s actually going to be able to make a sense of the other , is that the 25,000 genes are on the ground and what &apos;s the threshold they &apos;re on .
now experts come into play and make basic amounts of water .
we take this material and put it on a so-called called a so-called called a so-called .
so what can scientists learn from these data ?
you look at your entire genome and you try to find it , and you &apos;re trying to find the most complex with genes .
whether that &apos;s from individual genetic background or their experience , we don &apos;t know .
that we know how to attract poverty , we only need to do more for it ?
so here &apos;s a few more questions .
how do you know ?
so what is the problem ?
well , before it was all right .
and it was made many experiments that all came to the same result , so i &apos;m just going to talk about one .
so what is the best ?
we need this kind of information . we need more of it . and we need to drive politics .
and maybe we start small , with things where we &apos;re safe , you &apos;re going to be .
poverty is more reliable than scientific work , and a lack of data about the effects of the impact of the brain , which is the question of how to do this . but the damage of the damage to the help of the other trials .
so we start , because africa is , in a certain way , in the climate change .
and the legend reported that alexander went through these desert .
but you could say , &quot; invest in africa with 1,000 languages , and it would not move . &quot;
so let &apos;s look at the countries , and the specific materials and data .
i want to talk this from the perspective of the capital of the capital .
in tanzania , last week of the standard of the standard , the standard of the standard was called the life .
if i have to ask you , &quot; what was in 2005 the world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world ? &quot; would you think of egypt ?
because there are fascinating opportunities .
&quot; god &quot; is the journey that we all want to be inspired by being inspired and feel one with the universe , that life is funded .
you &apos;re going to switch a switch -- there &apos;s electric light .
i don &apos;t know why , but it thought they were .
i &apos;m going to run that , so you can take that kind of thing , and i &apos;m going to describe my reactions as i saw the first time .
right .
ok , you change , raise your right hand .
kt : yeah .
kt : no , no . i just see the street .
i couldn &apos;t see the blindfold .
again , again .
kb : how often did you feel that ?
let &apos;s close your eyes , five , four , three , two , one .
and if you want the pressure to go down , you &apos;re doing a more of the pressure , and it &apos;s just if you want the pressure to go down .
do you want to try it ?
and you feel a certain emotion , and if you feel the emotion , i want you to throw the bottle of the bottle into the bottle .
there &apos;s another thing i want to share with you .
ready ?
my hand is , here , in the world , in the world .
kb : ok . do you think it &apos;s here , right ?
first of all , keith barry shows us how our brain can be our bodies -- with a trick of the one , and then he &apos;s going to be working on the audience in some amazing ways .
i &apos;m going to be .
that &apos;s not for the one of four . this is for all four .
i watched both religious people are equally obsessed with morality .
the most remote thing is almost zero , if there &apos;s no stimulation to it .
they get the message of the computer , &quot; person 1 has sent them to this amount of money .
we showed that the gift of oxytocin is increasing to the generosity of the most 80 percent .
i &apos;ve just found the molecule .
he asked me , &quot; what should we do ? &quot;
in experiments , we have men to give testosterone .
that tells us that we invented this ritual to connect us with this new one .
and it &apos;s very easy to attract a brain to the most remote .
to go to the device , you need many , many people .
or should you not do that ?
they were pretty closely , &quot; you &apos;ve given us a device that works only on english . so we taught ourselves english to use it . &quot;
i decided to destroy my own argument by making a bloody statement .
absurd . but i had to follow the victorian norm .
how is the morning ?
we need to turn this imbalance off , from threat to pleasure .
i think it &apos;s right here .
i asked incredible questions -- &quot; when was the beginning of the world ? how will you end ? &quot;
and only one last thing .
maybe we should go to the next piece , because i &apos;ve just lost the scarf .
and the local was the local of the local , and found out that he was going to be in the official papers as dead .
so this area is the area of the world .
and the unemployed layer is in the privileged layer , which is able to pay several of the people &apos;s numbers and lead several households , common .
after these four children , you see the younger sister , who &apos;s going to follow their children who were killed too .
and finally , there was a single one who was sitting for me and later his participation was offered to be released , so i had to get it to the day .
with 16 , the kids have to leave the seventh , even though they can &apos;t get nowhere .
one of the interesting things is , of course , the combination of naked hand , and the technology , and of course , what he said about listening to our young people .
now my career could continue something longer .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
from him , the sound comes through the middle line .
or we do this , and we believe that &apos;s what blindness is .
rain . not bad . not bad .
individual jumps . but why can &apos;t i do that if i &apos;m learning a piece of music ?
in this way , the dove shows the dove of evelyn boothe , why that &apos;s a lot more than the music of music , as sound sound on his eardrum .
and it was so big until the point where it was a year of the last year in port-au-prince , and rick &apos;s favorite , and rick , &quot; millions of people in television . &quot;
but that &apos;s not the interesting thing about it .
cp : you have happiness that it &apos;s not going to be living to you .
peace and love were mentioned .
cp : yeah , but you still don &apos;t know what you should think about it .
this is 10 times longer than mammals needed to reach their inner size and to make all these habitats .
we &apos;re similar to the dinosaurs , and we &apos;re unusual in our world &apos;s own mindset .
basically it &apos;s a country that &apos;s not a way of our work .
this is a female of the jaw in his jaw .
paul has never been able to see a fossil .
these are all the most powerful things . there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
i became artists and started drawing .
the question is -- and we &apos;re dealing with this question for centuries -- how to do this kids in science .
but bad news for derartu tulu , however , had the same idea , under the olympic idea , and paula radcliffe , who is a very precise , full of all of the time .
show me a animal with a drug and the gills , then it has something to do with water .
we don &apos;t have our physical strength , because we &apos;re the largest largest world in the jungle .
well , emily , emily , -- one of 500 of the 500 , and the stadium -- she ends up on the place , under the best 10 , although they &apos;ve done the baby in the race to get her baby -- and the most , to beat the baby .
this is all we could .
but maybe it &apos;s different .
and that &apos;s what you hear to put on this kind of thing that you failed when you need four hours .
and in the entrepreneurial entrepreneurial , it was always about interacting with things , not with people -- with safety , with safety , of course , and the people would help to accept robots as part of our daily life .
monster is very , very bad .
the remote remote one was a photographic of our group , which they used three different technologies to interact with the participants .
and with this technology , you can become so active to the active participants in your grandchildren , like it &apos;s not possible today .
and the third possibility was a simple diary with paper and pen , because that &apos;s the most , that you usually use when you start a computer and sports .
another important idea is this idea of the character of the character .
i have style , laugh , a real hard , because it &apos;s not going to be , but it &apos;s not going to be the n .
it &apos;s going to go away , and i &apos;m not going to go . i &apos;m like , &quot; bang ! &quot;
when he wrote a computer , i was before the door .
i &apos;m going to show a number of photographs and movies , but i also do a little bit of a little bit of a ads , and a little bit of advertising , everything with the same concept .
from photography , this is the most powerful thing , it &apos;s going to work and the most , and what you can &apos;t have , you want to do more .
as you &apos;re in the collective consciousness , without that we know that , and how that happens .
it &apos;s very commercial .
and then you turn the photo that he &apos;s going to take , and suddenly it &apos;s going to be very serious and maybe less available .
85 percent of the global world &apos;s disease is in developing countries -- not in the west -- and yet 90 percent of the tools in the west .
just to treat . look at the situation in iceland .
but if you tell you , so we &apos;re trying to make the same in nigeria , then all of the time .
it allows the existence to make the existence , and we can use the experience very clever .
prevention has to be part of the solution -- that &apos;s important to us .
and we start a more engineering program , so we &apos;re going to get local people that can fix the equipment .
autism has a very large bandwidth , from very massive -- the child doesn &apos;t evolve -- until to brilliant scientists and engineers .
i love the film , like you all have my projects , that &apos;s the summit of the house .
well , what i learned early because i wasn &apos;t so social , i &apos;m my work to sell and not myself .
another thing is the sensory problems .
with other words , a problem with a equipment of a computer system .
the movie in the movie was called the .
i made a lot of the time in the southeast 40s , and i built things , and i learned how to do tasks .
another very much idea is , the kids of some of the many of the many of the many of the teas are teaching .
fs : i have passion for the things that i do , the world i do .
it &apos;s a extended reality that can track the projections and link systems , or just a digital storyteller .
the fifth time i stand on this coast , the horror , i look out on the far horizon , and believe that i &apos;m going to make it all the way over the big , dangerous wild of a ocean .
but it was deeper : how much life is there left ?
and then there &apos;s our most of our most , that you never really say , how far it is , we don &apos;t know how far it is .
but very honest , all of these talk i had just been putting , just to get the most different , they were very different .
thank you and much fun on the conference .
and that &apos;s perhaps the most important thing , he lost sense .
he &apos;s going to be the army . the army gives him a rifle .
so what happens when a medium suddenly brings a lot of new ideas in circulation ?
they had to synchronize what other philosophers knew . otherwise , they couldn &apos;t lead the right way of discussion .
but there was a programmer that decided that it was not the best kind of work .
everybody from them can do changes and they can do it in the prefrontal work , even though they knew nothing about the existence of the existence of the other .
this is called a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
something more sophisticated , that can happen to a culture , is that they can acquire a new kind of new health system : the , , , , , , , , right , now , that &apos;s not true ? right ?
don &apos;t try to do what other people do , and it &apos;s not a little bit better , because it doesn &apos;t get very far .
and if someone says you can &apos;t , then you don &apos;t hear it .
six to nine months of the time .
but we &apos;ve tested these rovers before we &apos;re going to get them out there -- or this one rover -- and you have sure everything works .
so we sent a spacecraft into the way to mars , it &apos;s called phoenix . this probe is going to land in 17 days , seven hours and 20 seconds , so you can put your clocks .
and that would be bad .
we &apos;re in this way , as we talk to the next rover , the next rover we want to send to mars .
and i know many of you have been meant to have this circular thing that these halls are really cool .
there were two satellites that are particularly interested in us .
it &apos;s like the cycle of the earth , but because it &apos;s so cold , it can &apos;t be water , because water would be frozen .
today i want to talk about how to understand these exponentially technologies .
so let &apos;s look like exponentially growing technology .
this is an example of this kind of thing .
there &apos;s wireless terms .
and i think many of these technologies are going to help us be better with our patients and take more time to focus on the important human elements of medicine that are expanding by this kind of technology .
the current trend in medicine is to become exponentially smaller .
let &apos;s get to genomics when 10 years ago , the first human being was done , the cost of a billion dollars .
so , very , very , very websites like the way that we &apos;re talking about the other , or the manufacturing of their data on the ground , or google health , will always be more important , all these possibilities on a kind of way .
we used the cells from the bone marrow to treat a patient with heart attack , we realized a improved , and higher , the use of the own of the own world &apos;s disease .
my poem is called &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their cats , god knows how many , which is on their own own , their doorstep , a , smell .
how do you cross the tiles in the side of the road , the stage to the street , and i don &apos;t look at me , &quot; can you help me ? &quot;
i was afraid , a part of me would be a part of the control , except control , and i would be caught in the bloody of her own favorite .
but i &apos;m afraid that the most successful way from coming from and i &apos;m going to show his own .
if we love , they hold me around , i &apos;m there , and not there .
we &apos;re looking for images that are going to drive attention to critical issues , images that are the religions that are going to cross the religions , and to do something with other words , to act with other words .
in &apos; 80s , the stigma was a tremendous obstacle , to discuss this disease or also mention it .
jonathan klein : photos that changed the world
i had read a lot of books and i studied a lot of books and the most remote .
i could see what i &apos;m going to see the flag on the stick , well , yeah ... ah , a second moment , and the music went to a computer .
finally , at the morning of the day , we got the most , we got the helicopter , and we &apos;re going to be the helicopter -- two helicopter in the middle of the ice -- that &apos;s the edge of the ice .
i knew that there were more open water water . and i had a computer .
i had known that , but i had expected something .
this was the view of my tent when i got this kind of phone call .
and only from the air i saw the picture .
and they were going to come back and they wanted to go back to the coast , and all five died on the bank .
and that said a jewish man , so that &apos;s a lot .
but some days later , we thought we were with our students about the students and we said , &quot; what would happen if this was a little guy in this condition ?
one day in a few years ago , miles in the coast of the coast of the coast in a world &apos;s most remote regions , 20 american , they saw their ship in the sea .
but in a certain point , most of the visions of giving these visions , and will be adult .
they have the same structure .
some of us tend to read their fears more than reading .
right read a fascinating gift of imagination , a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a way to look at a way to look at the future , if time is time , you look at it .
nothing happened . no violence . nothing .
we brought them into every living room of arab world -- international , global , through our english channel .
they were separated by their people , from the masses and now we &apos;re looking at it , one after the other .
thank you .
because we discovered that it &apos;s the people who want to be informed , and people want to be informed -- they get the most important thing through our internet .
and frankie said , &quot; i &apos;m as a 22 year-old , and i see the needle on me , and there &apos;s blood everywhere .
you want to share a needle exactly as little as you want to share a toothbrush , even with someone you &apos;re going to do .
so this is a picture of hundreds of studies of all the high animals in the united states , and this is the studies that are effective , that are effective , quite many of them .
so you can see this awful images from africa .
so i &apos;m saying , oh , great , great .
1.8 is a more of the streets on the streets . it &apos;s a girl with tail .
she was a total age of the age of her .
hey , hey , black-eyed susie , hey .
and a little banjo play . here &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
we were with the car at the time , texas , where i spent my early childhood .
and mother was just like this .
let &apos;s try it together with this old song , and i sing : there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , i know .
originally from the brothers , the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot;
well , that &apos;s easier to say .
we were not stupid : we put a piece of plywood on the distance .
when was new , i was going to be the thought of why can &apos;t you take the oldest the oldest rhythms , which is the &quot; chopsticks , &quot; and they combine with the latest technology ?
well , i think it works because scientists are connected to ethics .
it &apos;s significant to show a place in the room , because it &apos;s critical , not in terms of where other things are , but in terms of this absolute idea of space , that was for newton .
and in a relational universe , the only possible explanation was that it &apos;s kind of creating itself .
and you understand some things better than others , and therefore there &apos;s a kind of a more , and they take a lot of the way , and they take politics .
there &apos;s another tedsters that are talking about two years ago , jonathan haidt , who defined his work in three different levels .
and just to let everything .
while five months he was doing to experiment with a full of a complete kind of a very a very .
that wasn &apos;t very successful . and so on and so on .
or philip glass or a fireman or the chemical brothers , the chemical brothers , who all played you , they had their own cape afternoon .
after two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
and it &apos;s a transition that &apos;s just so much with the identity of living as the memory of the living .
but the most the most , the most the thing and the most the representation of wealth is also the status of the late , and the family of the late .
if we could extend our definition of death to include life , we could experience death as part of our lives and maybe the death of the other than fear .
i wanted to end my show with a dance ...
your talk about the water living in the water , and the context , the context between darwinism and the fact that we &apos;re all naked , less than that , and we can swim well .
ok , gordon , come on .
&quot; and now she has a fisherman . &quot;
eight years of the u.s. history , eight minutes of my show , are just so over .
and jack pogue says , &quot; i want to be a better person . &quot;
&quot; do this world to a better place if you can .
so i &apos;ll give you the message in advance : try to be extinct .
where are the little ? &quot;
here &apos;s the people again .
how you can imagine , is it a thing , a kind of a , a , but if you go into a museum and says , &quot; it doesn &apos;t worry if i &apos;m your favorite , or ? &quot;
and you could mean , there &apos;s one hint .
so we &apos;re a lot of the time and we &apos;ve collected a lot of things and we found a lot of animals .
so we know that the mermaid is actually a kind of a triceratops triceratops .
it looks like it even gets bigger .
we wanted to make a atmospheric architecture .
all the water of the world is being answered , so we thought that after you &apos;re on the water , it &apos;s moving through the water , and you can breathe water , you could also drink the building .
the drill was put on a 12 year-old .
then you get up in this glass elevator in the street &apos;s elevator .
before and after .
this is a guy from salt lake city . so that &apos;s where it looks .
&quot; drawn &quot; -- when they were being fed up a little bit .
it &apos;s not sure that this would be so gone when the editor would have been a woman .
by the way , &quot; wired &quot; has been taken to heart .
analyze the news , talk about , if something is missing , like the people in the new york times .
this particular plant is going to be a lot of the plant and other things from the air .
m , most of the time i need to get the morning , when i &apos;m going to try to figure out what will happen .
and then , remember , do you remember a computer of rice in a event , and it was drawn to it ?
pm : are you going to hit resistance than you did this for the rationale of their foreign policy ?
when i was secretary of foreign secretary , only 13 women were in other countries .
thank you that they were today .
malaria : there are eight countries in sub-saharan africa that could reduce their death rates to 75 percent .
for the example of the way , it &apos;s a kind of a zone , and it &apos;s fair to say that i &apos;m sexually sexually sexually behind this kind of thing .
to be exactly , in your capital , some of them want to cut in these heavy times , the treasury , and in the fearless programs like global fund .
in the contrary , it could save a lot of life .
if we take this metaphor of a genome as a program , you have to think that chris anderson is a more of the object , as well , craig watson , and all of us .
you design something like a cell phone , and in very abstract language , you call this cell phone .
this is normal dna , which is a normal dna .
we heat them , add something salt , heat , they &apos;re almost to the most , and they &apos;re cool , and while the most little strands of the long strands , the long and it is a structure .
so that works really well and you can build patterns and also form patterns , okay ?
you zoom in , there &apos;s only four strands of dna , and you &apos;re sitting on the individual , and you &apos;re sitting on other buildings that can be used to other blocks if they fit .
we have a very more sophisticated computer program where small changes -- tiny , individual mutations -- something that created a square size , and it made something much bigger .
and the calculations are used to be the most important , and to understand it and get it better into the handle , how feynman said , we need to build something to understand it .
but as we saw it , we had three of the things that we saw , a world war , which has completely separate , and universal , and universal for everyone with a medical , regardless of its financial devices .
in modern time , where time a important good , and the fight is hard to survive , is the ordinary of human beings and pays the bribe only to come to come .
in my last 18 months as a lawyer , in the fight against small and large , the case of india &apos;s largest business .
sm : well , the most important cost were less than 200 rupees .
this is the global footprint of all the chief of the last four years , which is going to come from new york to the small new new york in the corner .
so in one such amount of content , we usually do some things to make it easier .
so we use these of these , to find unique talks , that are a lot of different fields that are going to be together in the way that they are a lot of different fields , and that &apos;s what really creative between the fields are going to beat bridges .
no wonder that it &apos;s my colleagues coming up because the truth is hard to disagree .
the work of the most good thing could be like in a hospital like in a hospital .
at ted &apos;s brilliant ubiquitous .
how do things happen ?
second , for you , the first thing for you is nature &apos;s most famous american school .
and said , &quot; would you be ready to have a plastic waste in your community ? &quot;
a way to do this is not to get .
why ? because they &apos;re happy to do something that &apos;s right .
bill gates has talked about the importance of education and in particular about the model of the model of the model . &quot; know , is it power . &quot;
barry schwartz makes a passionate call for &quot; practical wisdom as an antidote to a society that has lost in the world &apos;s own . he &apos;s going to put that rules back , incentives , everyday wisdom , our world will help our world .
&quot; by the way , dean , the arm needs to fit a 50 year-old a 50 year-old , so you &apos;re going to give you a mile from the small finger , and he has to weigh less than four pounds .
it takes another nine to make it functional and useful . &quot;
he &apos;s doing that , what &apos;s going on to me .
boys and girls , you &apos;ve given enough .
it was amazing how positive they were all .
he wants to help me . he told me that he wants to go back to help his co-author .
how do we come out ?
you can look at war like a tragedy or a hippie look .
ford moved out . they &apos;re a leg , and then the other one .
in london , i lived in a half days in a computer with nothing as water .
and i have a little bit of the breath . in my first attempt , i don &apos;t even hold it a minute .
there are a lot of the people who are going to get so deep as possible .
he &apos;s a big big and weighs .
because of the movement , i wasted oxygen .
then his favorite and broke his record .
and there was no way to slow my heart rate .
after 14 minutes , i had this horrible stereotype like this need to breathe .
as a magician , i try to show people things that seem impossible .
thank you . you &apos;ve finished the institution now .
tamara , do you take this ?
even now , the human being is the most devastating thing that the human is .
in africa , people have been consumed last year , and two billion pounds of bush y consumed .
first , even if all the co2 emissions would stop today , global warming would continue to be on .
and then we saw a case on the east coast of the united states , and it moved to each other every year .
today , there &apos;s another movement . the movement , the earth .
and the fifth of the fifth , the image we see here , died .
i want to give you a introduction of a kind of an introduction to the way that we want to end with what this change means : i want to explain to you what &apos;s going to follow for us and our biodiversity , but also how much of our culture affects our culture .
and if it was just about it , it would really be really interesting .
in this salmon , it &apos;s still that it &apos;s a genetically genetic disadvantage , which is from the intersection of a gene that &apos;s made of a gene that &apos;s been growing up with a lot less food .
these are actually breathtaking and not real animals .
we took this animal to its autonomy . &quot;
in other words , this was the first creature in the history of this world , which had a computer as a parent -- it didn &apos;t have organic parents .
paul &apos;s : it &apos;s time to question the time .
if darwin had only the nasa .
cesar , in his different forms , is probably on earth since billions of years , and it &apos;s always been encouraged by evolution , like this as often .
and only in the last 5,000 years with rising frequency and distance .
evolution helps us .
tell it .
so , as old and the most , he may be , so he &apos;s very complicated and very simple -- and that &apos;s the same time .
then they measure ... and measure ... and measure ...
i kind of have a lot of a human being to put a geometry of things that actually didn &apos;t have geometry .
she was in time from the time of tube to $ 25 , an extraordinary era where mathematics was short before , from this world .
slow measurements , big results , ...
and this is what &apos;s a little bit of the way that it &apos;s .
that was one of my favorite favorite things that these islands were the same as the most , and more or less .
should you take the breast ? should you get them ?
right ? it has to be a lot of it , for that , it &apos;s a pure engine .
anyone ? it &apos;s much harder .
this can happen in a medical environment .
and why not ?
a few months later , she goes back to the market when prices are the highest , in the so-called the so-called , when food is , because they have to feed their family and not choice .
it leads too high to very high .
almost three years ago , i decided to leave my bold job as a senior economist in washington , and in my favorite ethiopia , ethiopia , after almost 30 years in abroad .
we build a system that &apos;s all the most common , the integrity , trust , efficiency and transparency , and the little farmers helps to deal with the risks that i described .
we believe that this initiative requires great political will , and we need to adapt the financial system , and even the underlying legal framework .
my answer to this is a wall wall from bacteria , which is going through the desert .
they threatened seriously the characteristic of millions of people , especially in africa and china .
a problem with the plants of trees is that people are in this region that they are trees , they &apos;re trees to use them as a contempt .
and , after the tasmanian cost of 60 dollars for the bacteria you have to pay back to the bacteria , a meter of the land would have about 11 dollars .
in a time , in a time , economic growth and more of the most valuable is that it could be caused as a result .
the world shows me opportunities , and i chose .
our goal is a resource of the designs , so that &apos;s what a single single single single dvd is basically a single single dvd .
all these eggs , the bacteria , bacteria , viruses can travel all in one gram of human fingertips .
it &apos;s a wonderful instrument to the gravitational boson .
maybe you think it &apos;s just good , if these men move shit , but it &apos;s also economically difficult because they save a billion dollars .
and it was a little bit of the way that the family had no toilet .
and the speed of the speed is we &apos;re going to reduce people with sanitation , not to get to germs .
these reefs in discovery bay , eastern europe , were 20 years of coral reefs .
he paid the slaves to get on the most remote . the song , &quot; the &quot; floating &quot; -- &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot;
and we &apos;ve been doing this in the last 100 to 150 years .
i &apos;ve talked about millions of times about it , but it &apos;s incredible .
the other species of the effect of climate change is the corals of coral . it &apos;s a nice picture , right ?
it doesn &apos;t sell .
and yet , we &apos;re , according to our best knowledge , alone .
what i saw ? stars , satellites , the planes -- typical , typical .
and what would be behind these of the most remote , if it was what was ?
and i was just embarrassed to all of the time , because i didn &apos;t read the novel &quot; the gymnosophist &quot; .
and it was so successful that it was even more successful .
and the way is a living is a living little city , and to come to the beach , she said , you know , you have a bus and then take a boat .
one of them was joseph and he asked me what i did , and i explained .
and so we put in the case .
companies are asking goods for households -- that &apos;s what we &apos;re -- and we &apos;re going to give income income to that , and that &apos;s better , so we can spend this income for more goods and performance .
the most , the most , the most , was under zero in 2008 , shortly before the crisis .
you can hear the idea of five-year-old hearing .
and at the same time , the solution is clear because this doesn &apos;t require the human nature .
we need to invest in the idea of a meaningful wealth that people provide , that people are developing .
first , it &apos;s not supposed to be economists , so it could never be done , so it could be something that you have to do in your sound .
i painted it directly on the man .
it went to space and light .
this photograph was taken when i visited the bay bay in alaska to test the tangible management service in the building of their life , oil oil in ice .
another aspect is that it &apos;s spreading when it hits water .
and that &apos;s actually really a really important thing .
and then , of course , john d. was the rockefeller .
she was also reason for the national of the national act act , the clean air act , the clean water act .
they have yellow in the economy , in economics . they &apos;re entrepreneurs , they &apos;re not going to do what they do .
if you look at people who earn 50,000 dollars in the years , the two children have , maybe three jobs , or more , they have to be able to be able to be .
we need to have the whole thing like the kind of thing , and you can find more about these politics .
the first person you certainly know .
and here she tells you to &quot; afghan star &quot; of how their friends are asking them , because they don &apos;t have to be able to go to their friends to be able to leave their own democracy .
last year , when i was here , i talked about my swim on the north pole .
it feels like someone behind you , and you &apos;re going to beat the whole time on the head .
and we put us on , and we &apos;re going to go to the , and we &apos;ve got what was wrong there on mt . everest .
and so , the most , more , is talking about that , and give a hundred percent . because there are only very , very few things that can &apos;t be achieved if we use our whole power for this .
this is a kind of a very simple computer . it &apos;s a very simple computer .
can we achieve a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a .
so what i &apos;m going to show you is that we can create a more of the most , a b -- b -- from a string of the components that follow extremely simple rules .
these are three minutes .
and if you saw amy smith , she talks about how to get students with mit with communities in haiti .
and it may be that we &apos;re all overwhelming , and it &apos;s overwhelming , and so that &apos;s also the variety of problems that we need to solve .
we &apos;re increasingly aware that we have to be able to have the entire thing to do .
okay . i also have one .
can we connect to the natural ecosystems around us by connecting rivers to the way we have more and more and more and more these things ?
as you can see , the death rate of 65,000 dead per conflict , a year in the 1950s to 2,000 dead per year in the 1950s , so awful that is so awful .
because we did something right , and it would be good to figure out what it is .
they want the most remote .
if not , one of the two are going to be fed , right ?
the developing world used soap and water , immunization .
and now i have the most important thing on this axis .
and they remember the beginning of the last century , that was very bad . until that so-called big leap .
do you see how they grow ? and how hundreds of millions of millions of people are getting out of poverty in asia ?
here we are . we have a continuity in the world .
look . this is the world .
they get clean water . they buy food for the poor . they &apos;re going to be malaria .
and we need to look at the way we look at the world with facts .
don &apos;t do it very much africa . don &apos;t do it .
it &apos;s not sustainable . and it &apos;s not going to happen to be a superpower .
and many of you have heard the term &quot; memes &quot; , the evolution of technology is something i &apos;ll give a lot of attention , so you know , one of the first things you had was a little bit of a little bit .
my argument is basically that , well , the fact is , the most , always part of our lives .
and that &apos;s pretty new , and i think it &apos;s going to be much worse -- this possibility -- because of developments in technology , in the world &apos;s information , which can be used as a weapons or nanotechnology .
i do my best , okay .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; is our favorite &quot; means &quot; he &apos;s saved the people &apos;s people , &quot; what to do a pretty advanced kind of advanced system .
we only have civil wars , which is called the media just over six countries .
so , we should be given our money ?
none of these countries , including africa &apos;s nation , has ever been the genetic state .
as this development , we were , africans , in the edge of development , and the creation of politics in our countries .
the manufacturing , mostly , costs a billion billion .
we &apos;d like to interview them . &quot; and i said , &quot; great .
and now , 14 of the diseases are uploaded to the disease , two of them even .
and in the last 10 years , and as hope for the future , we &apos;ve seen the beginnings of a science of the positive psychology : one science of what life does .
and i think there are three different -- and i call it different because they &apos;re on different interventions , it &apos;s possible to have a rather different life -- three different happy lives .
but it turns out that there was no sexual trauma .
you don &apos;t see how to get a lot of the way out of the world .
and what you find is that if you do something fun , the most fun thing is .
when i was a few years ago , i thought , if i was good enough to make someone not depressed , not willing to do it , not angry that i would make him happy .
a polar bear that &apos;s going on in the arctic , taken by paul &apos;s .
but this so-called &quot; snapshot &quot; is going to get all the parts together and not just the event , but also my emotional connection is coming .
nick -- again with a automatic camera -- thousands of photos shot of this .
sometimes you can tell a rich story on focused on .
we also want to find solutions .
and then all of you go and jump .
thank you .
what &apos;s more important is , there &apos;s a kind of a process that you can see in only three seconds : we can put emily in a period of less than a single afternoon in several different ways of a few different types of different and a half .
emily : image metrics is a kind of a computer , a lot of life .
finally , i was involved in it .
there &apos;s also a few beautiful primates in the reserve .
but i was from the west and worked in the east .
all over the place , all of the time , they were killed , they killed the forest , and so on .
here &apos;s what selective is going to be broken , and gold .
one day we met with the most remote .
the elephant just and they took the most , they were going to be the most .
i don &apos;t think somebody can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do google , because google makes the right thing , even if people like al google , to connect to us .
and wangari journals : a hero of congo from congo
we have almost no one noticed , from a market market to a market market .
they don &apos;t have to pay it from their budget .
i should roll them out , what happened with these experiments .
democracy doesn &apos;t need perfect equality , but it takes citizens that share a common life .
and the united states is the leading nation in 1900 , because where the line is to red .
we have this gift in the &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s , when women were in the world .
electricity was also helpful to the liberation of women .
a amazing fact for the most of the 20th century is that in the first half of the 20th century , the improvement of life expectancy is three times as fast as the second half of the 19th century .
that was the paper i was calling to 11 years and i got a two + a number of cards .
i have some , which was a long time : between five and 15 , this was my favorite , and that led to a feeling of failure .
so if i look at creativity , i think , there &apos;s also this sense of view or the inability to be the basics that i see between practical .
that &apos;s what buddhist fishermen say because they &apos;re actually not allowed to kill creatures .
and they &apos;ll notice it more often .
and i had to find what to do to the story .
how are we going to be the responsibility , what the responsibility and the causes are outside of a dish ?
and you have to be in all possibilities , including that i &apos;ve never seen before .
i hope you can see it when i &apos;m going to talk about this examples , because i &apos;m talking about everything you could spend .
now there &apos;s magazines about water .
people pay the full price for both , and the only thing they have in common is that they have nothing together .
the corners of the edges , the middle goals , is the big market .
these guys are asking the most of the world &apos;s most .
but you don &apos;t have to be a lot of the time -- you don &apos;t have to be completely a very of it .
so what you need to do is figure out who it &apos;s interested in .
nine months later , i &apos;m a messages at tahrir square . reason for that was a picture i saw in my favorite .
thank you .
mostly the cultural legacy in us , and the past is to go to the past .
my first documentary for national geographic , which i realized , you can bring problems in a documentary about nature , i had been exposed to the story of nature .
these are the lions and tigers of the ocean .
and because i love sharks -- i &apos;m sort of obsessed with you -- i wanted to be a different , more positive story about sharks to talk about the need of protection for sharks .
after i had left , i learned that this habitat is going to be a new kind of thing to create .
they also put themselves in the world &apos;s .
but when the fish came back and then the world &apos;s ocean , and the population grew up , forests of fractals grew up in the flat water , the forests of mexicans in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water .
now , they live in the jungle of the world &apos;s jungle and this is a little bit of the time , and you &apos;re the second son , by the way , the son i saved , the doctor i saved .
it was a biological desert .
then you see the returns and starts measuring what comes out .
so how do we break this cycle ?
and you need bacteria to tie the nitrogen , and without these microorganisms , it &apos;s not going to give it a performance .
the humidity is 10 percent higher .
so we can really change climate .
in the world &apos;s constant , there &apos;s a democratic culture , so you can use the law of the brain to protect the own system .
the most devastating thing that &apos;s a decent thing that &apos;s a a paleontologist on a computer system .
i &apos;ll show you one .
forty , a lot of the sculptures of the sculptures , makes a beautiful thing , beautiful works , which is going to drop in the pattern , or move into the waves of the waves , in nine minutes , he &apos;s inspired by mathematics and nature .
every city has her own design .
and 23 years later , you asked us to come and have this idea .
this is italian portal , the selective park , the most devastating park , the japanese park , the german park .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
either it doesn &apos;t exist or it &apos;s something else , or something else , but not a part of science .
people always say the consciousness is hard to define .
you can &apos;t do the existence of your consciousness .
it &apos;s a digital computer program in the brain and to make consciousness , we have to find the right program .
we &apos;re constantly bringing the objectivity and it &apos;s a properties of reality and as a properties of the manufacturing of the manufacturing .
... don &apos;t you find ?
but i also meet people who do what they do , and they could not imagine to make something else .
we don &apos;t teach american history in britain .
teenagers don &apos;t wear any spears .
maybe later , not immediately .
no , don &apos;t do it .
i couldn &apos;t make this thing work , no matter how often or how much i &apos;m going to do .
but we have to change from a industrial model to a computer model where every single school can be reported .
and i wanted to find more about it .
the reason that is the historical report is that the historical report is being interpreted .
and it was a light . she said , &quot; okay , it &apos;s serious .
she led a group of students in protest in protest .
i stood on , i was going to put a tea , sat down and now i &apos;m here -- still almost paralyzed , but here .
so peace direct predators are going to be able to do the back .
he wrote a book called &quot; by the sultan to democracy , &quot; with the mouth of the brain .
it &apos;s not such a kind of a thing .
in fact , chris worried , and he said , &quot; look , show you this photograph , you &apos;ll think you &apos;re still going to think of this crazy modern artist , which is not much . &quot;
it &apos;s a object for the mind .
and the solution i &apos;m going to do is to do the biggest evil in this massive , massive of the earth , and the of that is the biosphere destruction of the biosphere .
so i said , &quot; what would t be from the counter -- we call it a little bit of the way that you increase the effects , where you &apos;re going to get it to the impact , where you &apos;re going to get the impact ? &quot;
and he was a huge amount of a big school on the market that has increased our revenues and profit .
we literally won the most remote .
but five days later , back in atlanta , i got an email from glenn thomas , one of my people from the meeting in california .
so , frankly , a lot of us are afraid of working in the industry that the industry is threatened by technology and perhaps the most powerful .
and really , we need somebody to convey to us , so we have a experience with a mentally .
the arts , whatever they do , are going to store us every time they &apos;re approaching us , and to look at our to look at our to the most remote and curiosity .
the three sisters ahn with her passionate music , a new life , in tedwomen , start with the happy and the most happy , and then they play a little bit of the time , and then they play a little bit , they &apos;re going to play a little bit , disgusting version of the nintendo .
the manchester &apos;s fixed constant constant is named after my quarter .
he makes a bunch of money through the driving of special furniture for rich people .
we &apos;ve taken the curriculum of the american , which is in their sense of harvard , and we &apos;re going to be a more of the most , for mothers in the middle of the middle of the city in the middle of the city .
we &apos;ve noticed that you have to give you flowers and eat sunlight and expectations and expectations and the biotechnology , and you can always cure the spiritual cancer .
these kids who were given up from the world , which is from public schools flies , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re capable of , with affection and sunlight and the good music and confidence .
and it &apos;s been working on the way that it works today .
and i &apos;m going to allow you to take the concert , and i &apos;ll give you the music . and you &apos;ve ever got to decide , you have to sign a agreement that &apos;s used to support the money of school . &quot;
this is a space of the nancy wilson , which was built her album in our school last christmas .
the brown building , which is you looked at you and i &apos;ll tell you where i made my greatest mistake .
he came to me . he said , &quot; man , that &apos;s an amazing story .
and so he has a group of people .
bill depp tells a calm and amazing story of redemption through art , music and unusual alliance .
and the siege then brings the most , the code to the brain , and the result is a kind of a , which produces a normal amount of a normal .
but there was the most important factor , the problem with the code , and how to make cells better answers to make normal reactions , and that was our contribution .
they cover us with a invisible , a invisible , which is the attacks from the environment , so we &apos;re going to stay healthy .
but if bacteria grow and double and they &apos;re all involved in making these molecules , they &apos;re going to get the number of molecules outside the cell .
now we know that all bacteria can talk to each other .
this is just a photograph -- a computer of your skin .
bacteria have become incredibly powerful , which is going to be going on to antibiotics .
the fact is that bacteria have a collective behavior and they have a little bit of tasks that they could never do when they were just acting as individuals .
it &apos;s a great honor to me to get to this conference .
or the first one that comes in the room .
but , if we think about justice , aristotle says that what we need to think about is the real character of the brain activity and qualities that are worth it , you can get them , and recognizes it .
what would you have ?
charlie , what do you say to warren ?
here it is , like it &apos;s going to be a little bit of it .
so aristotle has been doing with flutes , and the more the more , the more and the more the question of marriage &apos;s marriage .
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic debate
many people said , &quot; well , you know , you don &apos;t know , you know , we don &apos;t have to say , &quot; we &apos;re going to start to say , &quot; we &apos;re going to start with our time .
and i think that &apos;s good -- the future humanity can make a decision .
if that &apos;s so , what does that mean for us ?
i &apos;m suggesting that the speed of the world &apos;s speed is going to be .
i &apos;m suggesting that &apos;s nonsense .
we know that there are this threshold because we don &apos;t have any clue , before we reach a more old age , and that &apos;s what the damage for our birth of birth is .
that means they have to make their homework to understand whether this is true .
audience : hi . i read somewhere in the last 20 years that the average lifespan of virtually every one on the planet has been spreading in the planet .
not one of their media has the most popular .
we don &apos;t care how we do our profit .
they were working in the center of the world &apos;s center and put on the agenda .
but i can &apos;t give a more of the time that are the more , the arguments that i have from economists , epidemiologists and environmental services .
the most scary thing is something scary , and probably you know a part of the most of the time .
14 americans die a day at asthma , which three times as in the &apos; 90s , and almost everything comes from the world &apos;s &apos; 90s .
he was obviously sense of humor .
politicians and the most afraid have scared of the time , as &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second , because we &apos;ve eradicated them .
so we thought , &quot; let &apos;s try . &quot;
there are some amazing animals .
immediately the government said , &quot; enough -- that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to go . &quot; and paid people to see each other , the most they saw .
he may think he would ever have been born the baby baby , so he might need a little help of outside .
i asked peter if something changed . and he said , &quot; no .
we want to do with &quot; africa : the next chapter , &quot; and that &apos;s , a healthy , beautiful , beautiful african .
but especially you have to be involved in your life , and a kind of productive environment in our countries , so that things can be done .
we can connect that all together ?
we were on the side of the world &apos;s side .
i had to associate between the legs of these people , with my sister on my back to find a window .
you know , we need to use everything good .
and often i don &apos;t see african employees under you .
now , the question is , how do we use it from all of these good will that come to us ?
you &apos;re a lot of the ones . &quot;
we have a lot of the most remote in nigeria with the most remote .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is effective , and i took this case to study that , so we can study them , just like we can study any other complex neurological process .
the method has been applied to the &apos; 90s to study extremely complex processes .
i want to try to show this for you briefly .
and then i &apos;m in the control of the room , here , games in change .
how do you study rap scientifically ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity , rather than that , which is involved in the world .
i want to say , probabilities and statistics , that &apos;s the mathematics of games and the most , and the most remote .
this is very satisfying and is not a pleasant thing .
but keep the idea of the age of eight seconds .
in games , and virtual worlds , for example , you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be used to the facial expressions of of course , and it &apos;s used to control a avatar or virtual character .
otherwise they &apos;re very fast . and without a stable grid , it &apos;s not possible , so kids die .
another statement of esther was that we react to a tragedy like haiti , but this is a kind of a kind of a kind of a .
it &apos;s produced by the malaria system , and it &apos;s a very interesting thing .
we have every street , every village , almost every square square of madagascar .
in your own computer , a very cheaper laser is a very cheaper laser .
audience : yeah !
interesting , although we have the whole time , we &apos;ve never done it , we &apos;ve never done the presence of the air .
this is the restaurant acorn house .
this is the most little one that you see here , actually , in a computer , which was made from outside to the inside and the way it was .
so , water is a more important aspect .
&quot; metal &quot; and &quot; earth &quot; are still from .
the idea is not a sophisticated thing .
they don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
once it touches the water , you should hear how air is out of air .
once we sequenced these two genomes , we asked ourselves : if this is the smallest genome of a self , it could be a little smaller genome ?
and the other thing is , we realized that once that worked , a real chance of doing it , if we could bring the synthetic chromosomes to make it the bacteria .
so care of care is the most important thing .
the last finally is a quote of robert feynman : &quot; what i can &apos;t do myself , that can &apos;t understand . &quot;
but actually , we &apos;re very close to the northwest in the northwest , and we &apos;re very close to the actual idea of paradise , the 36 times as &quot; gardens , &quot; &quot; gardens , &quot; &quot; defined . &quot;
but the more you add , the more you have lost .
and this number 72 is never coming .
this is a nest colony , and this is the nest entrance .
this is a colony which has been founded by a queen in the previous summer .
the most , the most , that &apos;s going to be a glass of glass -- are a interesting group . they go out early morning after the first group of the group is going on .
and occasionally , it looks like that , as if it &apos;s just half the colony colony , just nothing .
the nest maintenance maintenance maintenance workers just take all the things and bring them to the edge of the world &apos;s edge and put them there .
but the organizers are kind of deciding , not getting rid of .
and we did experiments that show the longer one ant out of the box , the more , the more , the simple setting of their surface . that smell is the ants that are different .
they &apos;re going to go down the entire earth , except antarctica .
here you see that the cost of this is about 89 million barrels of oil , and the annual cost of the cost of three trillion dollars .
and we do that for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
that doesn &apos;t have anything to do with it .
i think where we can use the natural gas .
and when i cost the natural gas system , natural gas is nine dollars .
why does it not worry ?
so , just 500 million people were wiped out .
it never was taken water , or something like this .
tbp : i lost 150 million of the wind , okay ?
some of you have 5,000 . many have more .
there were a lot of the time . and there were a lot of the time .
the life is a event . let &apos;s go to the world .
these are work in lower manhattan where you built the first of the first time .
these were maybe six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to be the light bulb .
a friend of mine told me this story : that didn &apos;t just come and wait , but then the most , but then the most , as they were there , had to call someone calls .
so , sometimes i &apos;m going to use a more clinical language , and it will not be so warm to you , maybe it &apos;s not going to be so warm about compassion .
and here &apos;s the basic idea that the most good thing to do for people who are going to be able to be able to be the most good thing for that .
basically , it &apos;s about when you &apos;re my enemy or my favorite , if you &apos;re not my friend or to my family , i &apos;m a lot less to use the golden rule on them . okay .
so , the results are going to raise . that &apos;s a zero-sum game .
every shape of the hydrothermal agencies , relationships , forces a , the humanity of the other .
and then you &apos;ll explain to you , the other thinking that america doesn &apos;t want to be concerned and even want to shave , and they hate america .
most diseases are in the case of poverty , but in the case of cancer , children seemed to be the kids who died in cancer , mostly from wealthy families .
a week died a child , but nothing changed .
because you &apos;re not using this kind of energy and time , if it &apos;s not really practical .
so he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
well , the dominant of the most dominant , that there &apos;s a single oncogene in a single cell cell , and that these you make you a more of the power .
what does this mean ?
we found a kind of a material material that helped the right pipe , we put the cells in and behold , and lo , in about four days , they were going to see , and what we &apos;re seeing in a culture is what we have in culture .
and of course , we &apos;re asking us where we go now ?
and so i want to finish with a poem .
we have a nonprofit journalist who was caught in the most devastating ; a young boy , whose book is so many of the most different quotes that you &apos;ve taken out of the shelves ; a 12-year-old stamp in new york times .
it sounds a little bit like a strange book , but it &apos;s actually about new ways of lying .
he wrote very , very positive , very positive , and surprise .
you &apos;ve got four good friends of a person whose personality is following .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can lie , and i was talking about it , and then they were talking .
they told how big the bathroom was , or said , the most little , and so far from the hotel .
two : right there . okay , glass , do a picture !
and you also want to be able to get your eyes .
but it really opened my eyes , as often as i have a life , i &apos;ve got to get a lot of life to emails , social networks and so on , even though there was nothing important or a more of the time .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band of the day .
and every one that then , i went to it .
at least for me , because if i just do the same thing , i &apos;ll be very , very boring . i &apos;m very quickly .
i see myself as ... i don &apos;t know what i see .
will you be nervous , the way ?
im : do you worry ? you see so cute .
so , anyway , i &apos;m not suggesting that it &apos;s good , but just that it &apos;s not comfortable , ok ?
if you have the sensitivity too long , it will be buttermilk .
i call it the era of the citizenship -- which people different race or ethnic , but yet , as citizens , but yet , as citizens , all the same way to be .
in egypt , i was finally discovered .
this was in london , in the yemen , trained in yemen , and i was going to go in amsterdam in amsterdam a plane to attack america .
there are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols that are using democratic culture on the ground .
as a anecdote , we can show that if poverty would be the only factor , well , i &apos;m the richest family , the richest families .
what happened there was a political coalition that was a political goal , and that was to get the leaders .
these tools are only going to be socially interesting when they &apos;re going to be technically boring .
he &apos;s a lot of the limits of the individual networks and then they then get a .
and because of social networking , chinese students who studied in abroad , or companies from the rest of the world , they had people in china , there were people all over the world that were listening to these messages .
and finally , the chinese was the chinese .

but all of it is going to be a lot of time , i &apos;m still going to take it as i was doing .
at my fourth side side , a comet moved over the mountain .
this view is the most , the first 600 feet of rise .
and that &apos;s in camp fourth , and that &apos;s in camp fourth .
and there were climbers on this summit ridge .
we also got the bad news that beck &apos;s embryonic , another climbers , in this storm , died in the snow and died .
it &apos;s so so so so so so clear to work up there that i even had the way that i was even in the clothes .
this climbers was a lot of the climbers .
and i can only do a long-term , like it did .
and so he will be able to turn back to the beginning .
these are a fool that light the most remote .
and the fourth thing that &apos;s very significant for me is , &quot; ideas that we have to share with . &quot;
but today , 60 years , through the liberal rise , entrepreneurs were to models , and they carry in great terms of society .
it was people who wanted to bring democracy to the democracy because they bring the ideas to the universal , universal , parliament and constitution and so on .
the third thing is again the cities -- the third thing .
the second is the most important thing we have , which is the entrepreneurs that make it so difficult to create a lot of jobs in companies , that 93 percent of indian jobs are in the indian area .
so , if you &apos;re a young country , you have the chance to make a modern modern system , so you don &apos;t have the most , if you get older .
you have to be a clear strategy of what matters for india and important for the world .
so the government decides to let you choose .
although some people don &apos;t like to hear it in the left , it actually was the revolution of markets that were formed the most , the government has no idea . &quot;
they &apos;re afraid of the masses .
so this whole constructive mistrust between the world &apos;s most , and that they represent .
and the most , more .
each of these of these most of the most , statistically , would be statistically , two years after the most years .
david cameron is going to be able to go back to a social social system to support this idea .
and the most of the time , investment .
i work . &quot;
why ? are you tired to get to the receiver ?
even if i &apos;m with my friend , jack , i say , &quot; i &apos;m saying , jack . &quot;
if you haven &apos;t found it , my name is tom grant and i &apos;m a kind of a , that means i &apos;ve just heard what you &apos;ve heard , just with my voice , just with my voice .
and at the end of that , with this one , i can do my sounds , i &apos;m going to go to my sounds , and let &apos;s repeat .
our people had to try about 5,000 different types of things to find the right .
don &apos;t listen to those who say that you can &apos;t do that . everybody can do that .
on the right , a little bit of a sudden .
and i &apos;m going to give you a few examples .
you see the blue &apos;s blue .
his wife said it was &quot; the happiest day in her life . &quot;
many of these patients are moving the most little .
the results are better than surgical .
he can stop the surgery anytime and immediately stop .
and the street street , i know .
and that &apos;s where you really have a lot of creative inspiration . so it &apos;s a industry that runs in both directions .
and so , you want to go to the next trend and that &apos;s how fast .
and their jokes , like the most of the most , work , really work within this aesthetics .

i hope i think that i think that organisms can help to make their remarkable , remarkable , and my part to protect their own longevity in the near future .
let &apos;s imagine something else .
20 years later , criminals use mobile phones , but they &apos;re also making their own own , like this , which is used by the most recent conditions in all 31 states .
what did you do with this ?
what could terrorists do today with the technology now , using technology ?
recently , the fbi has arrested in the u.s. that was arrested to transport these remote remote remote fields in the united states .
as we see here , we turn us into the auditorium .
now , the mortality rate is 70 percent , if you caught it , but that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s going to be killed so many people that the only thing that the best funeral is not going to be in the world &apos;s way that this is outside of the world &apos;s .
but in the other hand , i hear people like fear of fear , a certain 102 .

and there &apos;s no group that would be more susceptible to this kind of manipulation than young men .
patient capital is uncomfortable for people who are looking at simple solutions , and they &apos;re not looking at the benefits of the instrument .
but the entire community , all different brain levels , the most different brain , and the most remote , would sit down and pray . &quot;
because the most remote thing , if you &apos;re full of the juice , it &apos;s beautiful , she &apos;s going to feed the world , you feed the world , it &apos;s enough to be in the sky . &quot;
but no faces ?
ok , let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
i tried to make my wife a little pleasure .
why don &apos;t i get to my wife , locally produced by a local pad ?
but here &apos;s the problem . because a company makes a pad from cotton and it works .
so , i &apos;m seeing this thing in my wife , &quot; why are you using a terrible scheme ? &quot;
now , 110 countries can access to this . okay ?
and it was so beautiful that i was always there in the last seven years .

we know the big most big , we know the great moments , we know what we don &apos;t want to tell , and the sense of the thing is not ridiculous to make anybody ridiculous .
when we were alone , i was her audience .
it wasn &apos;t that kind of thing that was a lot of the time , but it was a kind of a kind of a time for my conversation .
he said , &quot; but i understand that . i can understand that . &quot;
half of the body was a lot of the body that &apos;s not .
this is a kind of a more of the in magnesium , nepal .
i don &apos;t want to do a nice thing .
there &apos;s a certain kind of treatment , it &apos;s called the more .
it &apos;s not the painting that we had made , but that &apos;s what we actually made .
another example : again , a stupid mother .
thank you .
no , we &apos;re talking about 10 million , 20 million dollars on the swiss bank bank , on the bank bank , from the president of the president , the high koreans of the state of the state .
they even go to the show .

if you want to go into a restaurant , if you &apos;re looking at the talks , then you &apos;ll expect you to get everything on the map ?
and that was the first time i thought that the expression in your face actually reflect what she &apos;s holding from him .
well , he &apos;s going to be sharing his life .
this french painter was known for his forever , but occasionally people were painting .
unfortunately , these dictators spend their most time with a series of other people in the archive , and some of them are beautiful paintings .

&quot; i &apos;m going to give you a ph.d. wedding , james .
my father lived most of his favorite time in east africa .
i &apos;d like to show you six minutes .
and the most , the most , but our movies , they &apos;re stories , they &apos;re stories that are able to identify our people .
so it &apos;s a young man out there , which can actually bring out what can be done , he has to think about certain negative things , and all of these , or some of the things .
and so , you know , so , you know , so much to say , so much time .
i think this is really the subject of this event .
and you know , you &apos;ve been doing this as a result of the world .
it &apos;s basically a cd . a cd .
now the art art art art . oh , that was fantastic .
that was really fantastic .
video games can be very profound , even though they &apos;re completely a lot of the time .
we show &quot; portal , &quot; because you &apos;re taking on walls to create new spaces .
so time , space , aesthetics , and then most importantly , behavior .
i had to shut up a few bridges behind me .
all of the time , it &apos;s all dependent on the most remote and students who were going to be able to meet a place .
so i made some sketches on the complacency -- little boxes and the things that i usually drew .
it &apos;s one of the most beautiful pieces i ever did .
this beautiful object , the swiss army , is going to be a participation for me .
and one day i had one -- oh , the other .
i &apos;ve got the most thin and the copper very thin , so it &apos;s going to be a lot of the time .
and that &apos;s my cafeteria .
and it reminded me why i was doing things like my house as well as my house .
she never finished .
the dome was a wish of the most of the time .
it was a try to make this little piece of land -- it &apos;s 30 on 240 feet -- to turn into a property , by measuring these areas and the dining room in this crater , with a high space in this crater .
they call this plan .
here &apos;s it .
from the building in the background , it seems like a player &apos;s iceberg in the mountains .
our clients don &apos;t want to abstract galleries , so -- and as we met our new gravitational environments , he said that this was or the right shape .
in hamburg , i was asked to make a fish , we just work on the foot of the world &apos;s hands , which was built by the most of the time , and the most remote thing was built .
can we not make clean burning , do we make clean burning ?
and one of the things they found was that they weren &apos;t disappearing .
and this is our favorite byproduct .
and he has the problem of health effects of the health of wood and coal .
it &apos;s a place where it would be , if it was india , in this room only three of us would have a car .
so you can &apos;t use the same concepts like the u.s. to move things .
there &apos;s a big difference .
after a surgery , everything .
well , this is not surprising . but we asked them to grade their honesty and intelligence , kindness and the most , and the most remote .
he married . he had a son called a son called the &quot; a son . &quot;
is this business with our outer and our engagement with this , and our engagement is a phenomenon ?
i want to tell you a little bit about the surgeries that we &apos;re doing , and where we want to do it .
we can replace the surface of the bone bone , but we &apos;re not very far with the fruit of palm .
my theme is the food in schools , because here &apos;s social justice .
and the next is the most powerful .
people are talking about sustainability , but we should find out what that is .
do you know all of you think they have to always be more and more food ?
and then , you know , we have a lot of the things that we can sell to children .
and this is a typical of a typical .
things that we might do at home , and for that important , we have to teach kids to teach children in schools .
we need to educate the employees .
this eight billion means by the way , two dollars , and 49 cents -- so much money is going to be ready for lunch .
as a little girl , my grandfather was sitting on a hot .
if i go to a party , and people ask me what i do , and i say , &quot; i &apos;m a professor , &quot; you &apos;re a professor , &quot; you &apos;re a professor .
i want to know your favorite , everything about your own beings , to know , that they are a professional in things .
don &apos;t make the tension . i want to be more likely to be more likely .
it &apos;s about a documentary in the mind of consciousness .
when i came closer , i expected to see all the details of most people , their clothes and so on .
where do you know that it was what they did ?
look at it ? who &apos;s not seeing it ? that &apos;s going to help .
we start to start . some examples .
today , jeff : his efforts described his efforts , a good thing to bring the neuroscience into neuroscience .
and the most of the time in london said , &quot; what do you mean with : &quot; who is in the middle of london -- &quot; i mean , nobody is in charge . &quot;
now , congestion pricing were introduced in stockholm at the third of january , and the first picture ; here &apos;s a picture of stockholm , a typical street on january .
so , we did this enormous survey with many of the most sophisticated and trying to figure out who changed and where they disappeared .
then i went to a half years -- from eastern europe -- by eastern asia -- through the mountains of the caucasus , the east east , north east , north africa .
what do we know from the taliban who are going to be the doors of people who are going to be the vehicle of their daughters in schools like to send their daughters to schools ?
the world changed .
i was in my office , my desk was fired , i had the blue of the blue .
and there were even two of them .
there was really what .
how amazing is that ?
so i want to talk about some other patients , and i &apos;m going to talk about some other patients in their power to improve health care .
and then i realized that the page of google earth reminded me where we can fly to each address .
we are , you &apos;re most of the most amazing resource in health care .
and the water of seawater is a more of the water .
here &apos;s the resolution . a wonderful creature , right ?
they don &apos;t take their environment with sound sound , and i &apos;m talking about the most remote .
in the united states , the annual cost of the annual cost of the land would be in a very difficult way .
why should we have to deal with aging at all ?
if you look at this , and in the night night , and this beautiful , flying animal , i wish you smile . thank you very much .
europe had to be in the economic development .
the boom of the raw resources are not all the , but it &apos;s not all the countries in the bottom billion .
so what &apos;s going wrong ? why are there the so-called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so the countries of the bottom billion is a very more powerful policy .
a few economists came in time and said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try to give a auction ? you will reveal the value . &quot;
in this moment , in the world , a billion people are stuck in poor or a half countries , like we can help them ? the economist paul declared a little bit of a little compassionate plan with the gap that we can do between arm and rich .
we have no container , which you &apos;re going to be made .
here he is a ted surgeon in africa that &apos;s required to make the way that we need to do that .
so we have this : imagine , you thought , you thought , you could talk to the people , and they could talk to people at the same time .
&quot; basics of the minimum surgery .
14 years ago , i came to the first time on this ordinary material , and i &apos;ve been using this ordinary material for centuries .
he asks me if i could build this as a piece of a piece of the city .
so we owe to small of the time to create a dry fog , which is shaped by wind , and it turns out that he can be shaped by people who can interact with it and move through , without becoming a lot of the way .
they were in their own in the grass , watching the scaling patterns of the world &apos;s own , and they didn &apos;t know that they didn &apos;t know , and they shared the miracle .
so , i was also paying attention to that that this is an enormous risk for our society .
when peter moves his arm , this yellow spot is the place that you see there , the way that you can see the activity in the process of the brain .
if you do this , what are you going to control ?
and to say that these changes are also going to be out of death , and it &apos;s a claim of a fact that can be true or wrong .
now let me ask you what i don &apos;t say . i don &apos;t say science can be this room or that we have scientific answers to each other .
now why would this not be a objective morality ?
how high is the probability that this is a summit of human development ?
on the left , you see edward &apos;s .
we live in a world full of the technologies , and these technologies can &apos;t be a lot of the things that are going to break out , and it &apos;s always easier to break together .
but then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
and what &apos;s its natural enemy , what the means of the good beetle that we talk about ?
it &apos;s a parasite , no more , but a more of the suppliers , two mm long , a quick and encouraging , a quick and encouraging .
and if we &apos;re going to get these good things to example , you go to the flowers .
in israel , where we &apos;re on 1,000 acres -- that &apos;s 10,000 israeli , biological pest in the world &apos;s -- 75 percent of the pesticides were saving .
third , to increase the farmers of the farmers for the potential of this kind of thing .
and the one of my favorite favorite is one of my favorite .
it &apos;s more fun to make the most fun of the most powerful , as a result of the other . i do that often .
&quot; urban &quot; -- that &apos;s what the new yorker needs .
her favorite name was a computer &apos;s name , and that &apos;s what it was -- i wasn &apos;t going to take a lot of the drawing . &quot;
or also , the soviet union was just a few decades , maybe within a decade , after the time , the soviet union was most powerful .
because there &apos;s 80 percent out there , which really is insects .
they &apos;re at the beginning of food .
why do we actually do this balls in the soup , and it &apos;s already meat in the soup of meat ?
it &apos;s 25 pounds per person , a year .
now we &apos;re deciding for that one , or to five kilograms of output .
we can increase them a little bit on the cost of rainforests , but it &apos;s going to be a boundary .
and you might think , well , they &apos;re not available .
my three minutes haven &apos;t begun , right ?
he said , &quot; please , we have to put them on the table .
and i saw a sign .
even if chad is the system , you do it on a way that comes to society .
and in this book , the little lewis would find the big idea .
this is a kind of a more , and on the back , some other people are a few other teas , and scales , to make some calculations . okay ?
right . so , this is going to be used .
there &apos;s a quality of a commodity and precision that is just amazing and remarkable .
so the first robot i want to talk about is strider .
that &apos;s just used to show that if you have cameras or other sensors because it &apos;s high , it &apos;s one meter of 80 , you can see about obstacles and the most remote .
for example , in this case , although the left and the right wheel are connected to a single axis and so quickly , and so fast quickly , it &apos;s going to turn fast .
welcome to the most of the time , the robot of quantum mechanics lab . &quot;
but the cool thing about it is the user interface .
and as he &apos;s going to see , it &apos;s our first attempt , and ...
but what is the secret of our success ?
but only from a centrifuge of imagination is not enough .
so , in this way , education is very important .
and the most of the time that &apos;s going to be a lot of the time .
there &apos;s basically no pool of good teachers , and only eight percent of the people of the county have been over a more than a more , higher degree .
there &apos;s a complete empty about creative capital in bertie county .
the goal of the game is , all the ted centers are going to sit on wheels , then there &apos;s won a team .
but in the last few decades , a lot of money went to the last few decades , it was completely gone .
and after outside , and the neighbors interview what they &apos;re buying , and why and why , is a homework .
in these is it &apos;s impossible to create big apples .
i want to invite you to follow my journey of the computer and explore .
after four months , it &apos;s coming out and now , and now it &apos;s eight months of dry miles before .
here &apos;s a few results : here &apos;s a few results .
this global act leads to climate change , like fossil fuels , maybe even more than this .
when i learned about these two things , i was very , very , very , very personal for a lot of personal reasons .
it &apos;s a very good thing to do , and it &apos;s a very good thing of the recycling of the recycling of the hyperbolic colony .
after treatment , we &apos;re going to make a series of simple the time to see a series of simple , to see how his vision is expanding .
the answer is in motion . i want to show you the next video .
i had to discuss a long time with my wife .
we &apos;re tracking these research research and hopefully , and hopefully , more results .
and then , i have a lot of these of these types of things for physically disabled , and i thought , oh , i don &apos;t know , but before i perceive that , i &apos;m looking at how this is so .
but that was the fall of 95 and then when the winter was in the winter , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , it &apos;s aimee to the most profound in 1996 , and she &apos;s very excited . your family travels with -- it &apos;s a big thing .
i tried everyone i could , i was able to do it , who , against what &apos;s going on , so against who &apos;s going to go here ?
i always won everything and now i thought , what ?
you can be a big big thing . take it off . &quot;
break : aimee and the designers will be at ted &apos;s 2 , and we &apos;ll talk about the design .
they got somebody who came over and the shoes .
but it &apos;s almost impossible , the actual losses of the economy , because it &apos;s , we use math .
or to the surrounded jobs .
and something about mathematics : math sometimes looks like math -- how in this example -- and sometimes it doesn &apos;t -- how do i be drunk ? &quot;
in education , we use about 80 percent of the time to teach people how to do three of your hand .
if people ask me , right ?
but the most unhealthy in cars allowed to separate these things , so that &apos;s what &apos;s going on today , as the building of a car and learning of its host .
completely wrong .
but i think we can do both at the same time .
and one of the reasons why this is so important -- so it &apos;s very important , computers in the tests .
it was 2009 , and i &apos;ve been blind for about a year .
i was particularly thinking about my father who was dead of the surgery of a surgical surgery at the brain .
similarly , just like you , just through the handle of the world &apos;s handle , which can change the ecosystem of the ground , and it makes a sense of where you &apos;re and what you &apos;re doing .
but when i was down , and the kew went along , i was blessed to everybody in every corner .
if you design a city in the sense of the blind , it will give many jobs .
to give you a sense of this experience , the article was called &quot; i think &quot; i think . &quot;
and the most famous thing i knew -- the 10 commandments , love your next , is fertile and the most , you know ...
you &apos;re going to get money for a good purpose and we developed emotional to the purpose .
it &apos;s not a book that was written and the sky was going to be a .
so , this is actually the key to me , to remind me that on the way , that &apos;s not the car here , and i don &apos;t go up on the way to go up the stairs .
that was very inspiring for me .
so if we want to put this book , you have to really have a sense of it , and we really have to be able to be able to work with him .
so we have this wonderful progress .
the academics that were thinking that was to be able to be a lot of the work , so we &apos;ve developed applications like this , and we &apos;ve developed the applications of the world &apos;s applications in a computer for a laser to a laser .
alex worked on a little , slightly more potent , independent , independent report with the name &quot; minority report , &quot; and invited us to develop the interface in the movie .
we &apos;re going to lead this kind of surgery through because we like yellow and the more of the green .
let &apos;s pull it apart : i &apos;m going to bring it into a lot of the time .
we , as humans , are the things that are designing and we should make sure our machines are helping us to help us and build it .
john , thank you for science to make reality .
what okolloh did was not possible without digital technologies .
but here &apos;s the point . the most creative creative act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that are shown by this black line said , &quot; we change this deal immediately .
they &apos;re created by the members of the community for each other .
and as all the good things , they make a jump of 20 years , when the audience changes the audience .
you don &apos;t always have five days to get to change . so , changes and we started playing , to play .
but india didn &apos;t want to play in the front table .
the other was indian cricket .
it was the new india ? that was another world where you could get the player from everywhere , as long as you got the best player for the best price .
we &apos;ve been seeing games in calcutta , but we &apos;ve never seen something that we &apos;ve never seen . i had a computer designer , and the audience was going to be a song for a sunday song for calcutta , not for india , but for calcutta .
could you imagine that this day would come ?
hopefully , i &apos;ve done a experience of the richer , and the game is more popular and hopefully , and hopefully there &apos;s a longer time to work in this business .
and you know that the answer is dogs , because they have fast in memory , as often as they have dogs and pigs on the rope .
why about everything in the world , anybody should play the lottery ?
on the other hand , if you visit a developing country , and for 25 dollars a more , a lot of a time , it &apos;s a big mac for a big mac .
would you spend your remaining 20 dollars for a ticket ?
i &apos;ll give you an example .
and if the way to the other end of the city is 100 mice worth 100 mice , it doesn &apos;t matter about it , but people don &apos;t think that .
well , in the big and all of you , you &apos;re enormously impatient .
watch what happens when we &apos;re shooting in the way .
dan , i &apos;d like to hear more . so , you say , so , we &apos;re going to say that our answer is to terrorism , i mean , that he &apos;s a kind of mental mistake ?
there are no guns .
and so some people look at economists as stupid people .
and the problem is one of these most of these , which requires a certain intellectual activity , because you &apos;re always comparing the variation with the subject that you have in mind .
&quot; in words , in fashion , and in fashion , the same rule is fantastic when to new , or too old , not the first one is trying to put the last one in the old world . &quot;
and i woke up one day , and i said , &quot; well , maybe it &apos;s not that ? &quot;
first , my willingness to give me a critical audience without appreciate me .
it &apos;s my intention to go to the poster , you should not have understood it .
so , in the big and all of the people , they &apos;re going to survive .
jews often have a uncomfortable smell .
if the space was crying , we could see that people are more negative to the gay men .
it &apos;s as if i was going to talk about what i &apos;ve done in these 20 years .
it feeds my mind and my soul .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends , other filmmakers , and they talk about what cinema means .
without food , i was sick .
we don &apos;t need problems more to get the idiots out !
our government was corrupt .
so , for me , the thought that we have all these kids , it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of children that had to be so much psychological or damage to africa and damage to africa .
through the whole book , more than a hour of a hour , and interactive animations .
what is the business ?
it was at least that you seem to be , in fact , to stay in , largely true .
so i thought , &quot; yes , that &apos;s a good idea . &quot;
the talk still about it .
when i came from college , i worked in southern california , and you &apos;re working on the spanish of the spanish and things like this .
rsw : how does his ikigai look like ?
the most , you &apos;ve interviewed me for that , and they sent me to the technical system of bilbao .
this is reminded me .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; so what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
if you &apos;re going to go to three months with three months , the ideas are always more clear and alive .
and one thing i wanted to mention in my favorite is , but somehow , it was , all the companies , to thank me , was helped me to thank you .
but in the meantime , these things win momentum .
and this is 10 weeks later , from hand .
you see the defenders , the most remote .
the lucifer effect of irrigation and things is remarkable , and this is what the most remarkable thing should be .
it &apos;s an incredible endeavor , 15,000 workers , i think , five ethiopian and the sixth is built here .
on this level , the 1,500 workers work .
50 percent of the computer on the world land in china .
it was quite unusual , so stefan , that less than five percent of advertising had a picture as a theme of the a theme .
and wish three is : i was told , i was going to be able to do a , and i always wanted to do something like this .
and it &apos;s increasingly more important that we can figure out how we can win these resources from this extremely complex .
the traditional ways to separate material is not working for plastic .
the traditional way to make a lot of the way is , with oil or yoga .
at the end of this process , we have a mixed of a mixed , many different kinds of plastic and many different qualities of plastic .
now i see a lot of the most of the time out there .
and what we see is that people tend to make mistakes on the exact same way , again , again .
maybe we should study how monkeys make economic decisions and figure out whether they make the same stupid as we do .
here &apos;s a luxury . it &apos;s going to share a token against food and wait happy , and you get your food .
they &apos;re waiting to be impatient that the market opens up .
imagine that i &apos;m going to push every one of them to a thousand dollars in the hand -- 10 of the people &apos;s notes .
you can either choose a more of the loss of loss -- so i throw a coin .
if we made the same scenarios in our little more scenarios , you would be able to do the same things like people ?
the person to the left is a safer loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just people on the last stage of development , which is stupid errors .
and that &apos;s the catch .
but if we think of building areas , most of the stories are very high .
we need to have less with concrete and steel and we need to build higher . in the last time we &apos;ve worked on the world &apos;s time .
this is a lot of , as we would have a year in 900 cars , less on the streets .
and the curtains exploded my window .
maybe , &quot; citizens , &quot; because recently they were brought up to fight against the tasmanian law . the citizens of these networks work together to help each other .
and the largest and oldest bank in russia , largely in the extended government , uses a lot of the russian government , now , to be a staff and citizens in development with the development of innovation .
we heard about ted , and we &apos;ve heard about people who have their plants with participation , and they &apos;re working on the world , and they &apos;re working on the world , to make websites and to turn videos .
and so i started thinking that the eternal mother always asks himself , &quot; are all children there ? &quot;
this is compassion .
he asked them to be a message , and all of them read in their own language , which was a version of the golden rule : &quot; what you don &apos;t want to do to you , &quot; you know , the most little . &quot;
a pastor is called to be able to take this individual needs .
and we do this through some of the most talented .
there are over 180 messages in washington d.c. .
it &apos;s already taken from parks and sculptures .
it &apos;s from the plastic fiber .
there &apos;s also a few constraints on its lighting .
the bubble is a kind of a more , a more of the way .
i saw my aunt when i was only five .
one of the things i experienced when i was trying to eat my friend because we didn &apos;t have food and we were about 400 .
as a child , as young and stressed , words i can &apos;t forget , not forget .
this is my story , shared in the form of a lesson / memory .
my breakfast , my lunch , i was in a foundation that i started , because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give the farmers tools .
audience : yeah !
the third chapter is a more complicated thing called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that means more than 60 percent of it .
we &apos;re going to solve this task by the best by turning the problem of death .
and even if that happens , it &apos;s not too late .
i remember nothing about time when i was five years old .
the santa claus knows whether you were good or not . right ? &quot;
but julie , you were so willing to be so ready for school . you were so willing . &quot;
they looked at each other and smiles , where the senses was the right answer . then they said , &quot; do you think we all brothers and sisters are on this earth ? &quot;
maybe your bigger ability to cooperate and adapt ?
i think this film shows the hardest look at the modern times : &quot; the street &quot; the street &quot; the street &quot; the street &quot; the road &quot; the road &quot;
in world war , we had to produce a lot of stuff .
but we cannot forget that it needs a fundamental contribution to it , and that &apos;s how many resources of the planet we use .
but now , the good news !
it &apos;s maybe in latin america .
and at that point , the skeptic and the climate change of climate change in terms of climate change .
we &apos;ve done a project for a few years ago , a big program , it was : the most , many people -- many people -- many experts were involved in the evidence -- a strong kind of a little bit of a sudden .
one group of people , they spend it for themselves , and they should spend the other group for other people .
when they went from the first building to the second building , all of the time , they went to a man who went down and went to the way , and clearly , the question is , would you have to do and helped ?
the word is &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &#91; about &#93; , &quot; &#93; the whole life : the hidden life .
since -- now , it &apos;s four decades -- i &apos;ve been trained with the best in this area , and i had a young way to have a young , young , and i was teaching , and the most old net of art , and the awards , and the awards .
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my real life force .
i dance between the most of the time and i was looking at it , and i was looking at this on my favorite .
well , it was essentially frustration .
this is like it was at the time .
he put them together , and they put this together , and then he was going to put them in this software , which i think she was originally developed , and he created this wonderful presentation .
in these documents , there are little pieces of applause , small boxes .
i want to suggest -- yes , do you make a nice website . how could i say , you don &apos;t have a nice website ?
now , you ask the linked data that you put together . 32 hits , from which everybody is a protein with these properties and you can look at them .
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s called linked data .
all of this will lead to that every year two million children die less than the year in 2000 .
and if it &apos;s so , we &apos;re ready to collect feedback and give feedback to ensure that the promise really provide outcomes ?
you just show one of the numbers there , which is 5,000 -- is that the number ?
my brothers started to draw me for the summit and draw .
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve been fascinated with to explore this area .
how many of you have a cow on the road to be able to go from bangalore to 1,400 ?
it &apos;s just like people are trained to be the reality of reality , and that makes meaning .
and they said , &quot; okay .
can &apos;t you do anything , you &apos;re artists ? &quot;
this is a box from the computer .
because if we see somebody , then we see the footprint .
what percentage of it has made foreign science ?
obviously , he was sitting in a cave in a cave .
so the foreign government is actually quite appropriate to come here , because -- if you think about that , i &apos;ve been talking about economists today , and that most things are very much more sophisticated .
this is the place i showed you at the beginning .
we &apos;re going to be a little more technical .
think about toyota .
you can &apos;t do it about selective , so you accept it and find it a way to work with it .
it &apos;s very hard to agree .
it &apos;s a lot of the time and the most remote .
pizza is going to get them , if they have hunger .
there are millions of different types of things .
so remember , if we think about sexual education and activities , they &apos;re out of baseball .
it &apos;s the poet &apos;s poet , and it &apos;s like , &quot; i can &apos;t be able to be the most important thing .
and that &apos;s , &quot; how much percent of the day you think about this person ? &quot;
in the beginning of the world , people have taken the brain structure of this brain structure .
they came home with the percent of the dinner .
and it was really a strong force .
and i said , &quot; why do you think men are the most powerful than women ? &quot;
no time on this were the women in the planet , the women were so educated , so interesting .
she &apos;s been 23 she was taken her for 13 .
i started to get to the way why you love to love in love with a person when the other .
they &apos;re going to be as long as the human race is on what shakespeare called these pink souls .
but unfortunately , i know it .
most researchers believe that obesity is the cause for resistance .
maybe we should ask ourselves whether it might be that the resistance is the cause of weight and the disease of disease -- at least people ?
other people , it &apos;s too much more .
peter : what if our views were wrong ?
my great , henry ford , really believed that it was the mission of ford motor company , the life of people to improve and make cars for every affordable .
and the good news is that we &apos;re going to be the big problems today of cars and environment -- not only ford , but in total as industry .
i think you can imagine it already .
but what really inspired me is the possibilities that we &apos;re going to have when our cars start to communicate with each other .
we need an infrastructure that is able to support these flexible future .
this is a minute of retirement .
i think now my mother , i &apos;m like a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of a kind of kind of kind of a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind .
the nurses have to put data together .
that &apos;s really important . it &apos;s much . &quot;
so what &apos;s coming out ?
and for us , it was great because we won a lot of prices .
i was infected when i was 17 , then when a student was a student , i came up with adults who were really believed to my ideas , and many of the most many of the things that i drink with me .
now it was just about the kids . so we don &apos;t .
basically , we gave the kids a simple task .
for our auction , we have some wonderful images for them , for a really good purpose , the money that they &apos;re going to give us to buy hearing hearing .
but what i never said , and what i want to do is , is that the most cool thing is that the most cool thing is .
in a way , in the elegant or a cocktail , the product is available here , which we have a lot of the morning , the most important way of development , which is another kind of development -- and inspired by incredible ways .
if you think about the change in our society , the most remote of the country in the cities , the 200 years took the same process in 20 years .
it saw changes , even though these were unknown .
so , for example , we would put the models under an artificial sky .
i think a reduction of 94 percent of 94 of 94 .
and how do we do something more of the growing world , especially in some places that i &apos;m talking about -- china , for example , in the next 10 years , the 400 new airports will build in the airports .
and this is the focus of the talk -- there &apos;s no lighting in the positive sense , which is healthy and our well-being ; without reasonable darkness .
unlike the first office , i showed you the beginning of the talk , this is a very well-known office , which is the most popular .
and you see , you see the building building , which later became a icon of modern health .
i think what you &apos;re seeing here is quite amazing -- how much light in the sky is going to turn and never reach the ground .
this is not very pleasant and the most pleasant .
they &apos;re not going to be able to get up .
if our most weeks , how some weeks before , a war in a third of india is called about 200 , which is the theme of the world , he &apos;s going to be able to get the theme , it &apos;s wrong .
and one day -- i don &apos;t know what happened -- while i was home from the office , i saw a client , or it was in the sense : could i be like a client , would be wonderful .
anil gupta : but what &apos;s it going to use ? what was it used ?
to do what ? to break rocks , to dig up .
this is the only place where you could express your creativity .
they don &apos;t want to be a second choice of standards and the most remote .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s made of the most important thing .
i had to be a ph.d. .
mr. , who lives with a physical challenge , just 50 inches is just 50 inches .
and the most , more , more , more , more , more , a lot of the time .
this is a lot of the time .
these are a pack billion people .
or ski . it &apos;s just fun and people love it to do it and do fun things .
so we &apos;ve been working very , very hard , but we knew it wouldn &apos;t be so hard to develop the technology of what matters and how the technology can be used .
cars are not made for the side of the side ; it &apos;s wonderful to give you a wonderful amount of time to go between cities and go to the world , but think about it : we &apos;ve solved all the problems in terms of range and speed .
so if we could put this box here , we could have a solution to a few years , electricity , electricity , and communication , and maybe drinking water in a sustainable package , which weighs 60 kilograms ?
otherness or a more loudly is that people who die there , somehow in the drug , is that we &apos;re going to be able to do that , or even both .
go to zetas as a killer of psychopaths , which is fear and the press , and the press is going to get to the silence , and that &apos;s true to most of the time .
mexico and the u.s. , now , is actually a international organization , which is a really international organization that partnerships with production and global partnerships in the global distribution .
but also part of it , a month , is to be a month -- you live in the future . and we have a long time .
and after you fall under a critical price , it tends to be successful , and it &apos;s a critical mass of a mass of a breakthrough .
but they &apos;re going to be very , very cheap , and look at the interesting effects , if you &apos;re getting cheaper , the brands , the most , and so , the most , they win , win .
if you look here , linux is in red , it &apos;s achieved 20 percent .
&quot; open accessible is really , you know , the gift of silicon , the world &apos;s gift .
because of some of the technologies we talked about .
patient capital works in between and trying to take the best one out of both .
the second thing was it had to be very cheap .
president obama understands that .
because one of the poorest farmers in the world had access to a technology that allows him to change his life .
and yet , this is exactly the properties , for men and women , and they were honored by all generations .
they remember , while the most of the time in the computer was , in his blog , it &apos;s a lot of the hurricane and the most often it was , because blogs are easy to use .
i like music , and i like to be a little bit of the way , and i think i heard steve martin , and i said , that can be .
i wrote this post , and i took this to einstein today .
and you see this post .
these little things are .
and maybe i have to be a lot of the time , because i &apos;m going to talk about it .
he was been able to get sustainable , except from our generation .
we need to use this process immediately to get a better understanding of the ocean .
we &apos;ve studied these fish in the curved . but we had to learn how to keep them .
but that &apos;s just half the size of the largest tuna we &apos;ve ever tagged .
they come together . that could be sex under tunas , and there &apos;s it .
you can get a lure -- it &apos;s a lure like a seal -- and a white shark will go to this , a little bit of a creature that comes out of our 16 feet .
and then we give us these animals , even a encore by helping us .
and the white shark .
i think he didn &apos;t think that the record of my specialty was so precisely .
they said , &quot; besides , about that , we &apos;ve talked about that , are they groups that want to harm the united states ? &quot;
you don &apos;t have to waste your energy for it .
now , who &apos;s looking at my favorite , see that i was there , and i know i was at the ninth of may be in the northeast of may .
all of the moments i &apos;m going to share with a life of my life .
when i started with the project , people said , &quot; why would you want to say , what you &apos;re doing and where you &apos;re ?
now it &apos;s normal .
now , look at this kind of thing of paris to see how incredible the growth is .
i looked at thousands of these projections , and trust and efficiency are always a lot of elements .
how do we predict how trust from face is going to be built ?
i was kind of a mind in the system .
this page gets to a day , and 80 percent of it gets a precise answer .
i want to start with a paradox .
and here you see it in relation to the degree of inequality that i &apos;ve shown you again .
first of all , the rich , developed countries , and then in a second , the 50 american states , with the same question , is the more important states , the more important states on all these scales ?
with devastating effects what the use of talent of the population is .
and in our analysis of american states , we find the same .
the social judgments are taking judgment , and the fear of these judge .
or for example , why violence is more prevalent in more sophisticated societies , because people are sensitive to being applied to it .
a year more than three million clicks , or a new knee , or a more of the time .
you remember how kamal had before the most remote .
if you wear it under pants or a rock , or a sari , it &apos;s very clear that they wear a prosthetic , and in societies where disability with a social stigma , people are very sensitive .
so thank you .
you want a dirty magazine ?
i even bought the most of the most the most , and there &apos;s a little piece of paper , which is , &quot; use this kind of thing to do , to the tanks .
this is the results one to the 20th of a 20th , &quot; look at google just as many &quot; o &quot; o .
strong fear is a lot .
but if you &apos;re in this condition , the work would never be done . because you would say , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve found a new way to do it . &quot;
almost everything we do is subconscious .
it &apos;s about being safe in this world .
would the park park and would fall apart , then they would never go to a ride .
it &apos;s a very small sample -- you should not be able to do the results .
so i &apos;m going to talk about children and self-organization and a series of experiments that were going to be able to look at the idea of an alternative education .
and the night of this day , 70 children in the internet .
so i could actually choose samples to cover a marker of the world , which represents the whole world .
what you see obviously is , there &apos;s a child that &apos;s using the computer .
natural systems are all self-organization : galaxies , molecules , cells , organisms , societies -- except the discussion of the &quot; intelligent designers . &quot;
and it &apos;s about the beating of idealism in this whole world .
i bought a nice suit and i wore shoes with a little bit of the access and i was wearing this remarkable access to the i had to be .
but 2002 , as my tour went to end , i decided i didn &apos;t want to go to the job that was waiting for me to go back .
i felt that something was destroyed .
and i went through . i went through these amounts .
and i traveled to kosovo and i ended up there .
independent diplomat is part of a trends that comes to the world , obviously , and it &apos;s going to be shown that the world is harvested .
it &apos;s terrible that they &apos;re these people who are actually affected , not a lot of it .
this is the politics of the 21st century , and in a certain sense , independent diplomat is this kind of thing that happens to us all of us .
&quot; hey , could you get me even more likely ? &quot;
because if we go back to the most remote , they understood by these practice that a simple mistake can say what you can &apos;t do , or remember why you love something .
we feel awe , pity .
go .
what is the number one ?
no . in the &apos; 70s , there were the grim show , the most devastating , the 1973 , the 1973 in the top 10 , followed by the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; three angels . &quot;
i can choose them from the island .
and i &apos;m very excited about that to talk about them , i &apos;m going to go in and say , &quot; can anybody tell me the basic basic thing , and why that is so cool ? &quot;
next , this dna rate produces the bacteria that are going to get the bacteria .
from a series of reasons .
or even worse , scientific education will always be more like the guy who says , &quot; actually ... &quot;
but we have so much work , and if somebody in science is involved in science , i &apos;m going to ask you to get to me .
we &apos;re going to go up and learn a state of consciousness .
so many books about war say the same , which is not a lot of people like war .
durkheim believed that everything is all the time that we take together , a seemingly inspired by holiness .
he kept saying , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he uses the other .
once they were all in a long tribe , they could keep the benefits of cooperation for themselves .
it &apos;s about connecting to other ways to get ethical ideas .
jh : thank you .
so quickly , i realized that the senior that is not only in the inside .
and right next to the garage , he has his own own , where he can go in his achievements , which is a more important role in the world .
everything has become easier in design , and here &apos;s this kind of thing , and , my god , i just photographed it , i just photographed it .
&quot; the end of print is going to be printed for the fifth time .
this book is called &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is actually an experiment for a client , and that &apos;s what we did in a sequence of six photos , and i tried to get people over the dodo medium .
they said that people didn &apos;t like them .
a article about brian &apos;s -- a really boring article -- so i put the whole article in the world .
somebody told me today , there were these things that the folder is called , but i don &apos;t know what that is .
that &apos;s for most professions very high .
before there was , obviously , no technology . but obviously .
this is not another planet . these are things that are hidden on our planet .
and finally , i come back to this kind of thing .
this is a lot of the most , it was a stephen jay , by stephen jay gould .
we heard from the most of the time that guns give up guns .
and i think that &apos;s really important . because if you can imagine mozart of the invention of the technology of the technology -- what &apos;s the loss for society .
octopus is interested in the first time when i was very young .
he takes back to a arm , and it &apos;s going to take a arm full of a little bit of a little bit , and it &apos;s going to go ... &quot;
but the point is , we were a month , and i wanted to be used to the animals , so that we could see their behaviors without to make them .
and if you go down to the bottom , the lovely blue water , you &apos;ve got to go to the beginning of it , and you &apos;ve always got a lot of the time .
but there &apos;s no sun down there , there &apos;s no photosynthesis . it &apos;s a world &apos;s world down there , which is it and it &apos;s all so upset .
but i &apos;ve also seen the exact opposite .
everybody talks about each . then there &apos;s no cuts on a map , and then it &apos;s a network that we have created .
she was a big , and she didn &apos;t go and i went to the way that little girls are , and she didn &apos;t buy me a pink clothes , but knew , i knew , but knew , didn &apos;t know .
my parents were going to be drunk , and my sister was arrested .
cities are the novelty of civilization .
is edinburgh a horse ?
we &apos;re going to take our entire economy , shown in the corner , and the corner is , the bottom of the left .
the heart rate is reduced , they live longer , and they &apos;re going to be able to slow out of the membranes and nutrients through the membranes , etc . , etc .
all the most important thing is that the most important thing is that the equivalent of the system is the equivalent of the metabolism , bigger than one is -- about this about this .
they &apos;re rapidly growing and stop , part of our own .
it looks like a kind of a kind of a kind of a .

so four , you say , &quot; if you don &apos;t have the information , you offer the help , i offer my help . &quot;
and every time i talk about what i want to do , i &apos;m at least a short time to address why body is meaning .

from many reasons , the decades of the second world war was a historic time .
there we are as a country .
we will be a nation with two classes .
this is really a social disaster , and the liberal is very concerned about it .
but the ones there are not yet . so i have to make them .
they &apos;ve been in the architecture for the time in the architecture .
you see that in these kinds of things that the protocell actually moves from light and move into the dark .
it &apos;s been done for me almost three decades of hospitals . i &apos;m probably most proud of the world .
instead , i &apos;m a professor professor for law , psychology and psychiatric gould on usc gould school , i have a lot of good friends , and a beloved husband , wants to be here today .
i quote from my records , &quot; i had my classmates , and i was asking my classmates to the friday of the friday , where we wanted to work together in a homework .
then they put me on poor and legs with the bed on bed .
i &apos;ve never met a more of the time that was agreed to be that view .
i could immediately let you go to a hospital , and we could do it very much . &apos; ha ha ha .
the american prisons are full of people who are hard mental , and many of them are there because they never got a reasonable therapy .
so we decided to build a different car car .
these are four billion hours that will be missed alone in this country .
and i said , shortly , there were lots of water and not very many people .
the montana in montana have already done a lot of things to reduce their water water , but they still use millions of gallons of water .
he paid to let the water go to the stream .
i don &apos;t like to be a problem , without the ones who work on the solution , so i want to show you a show , like mad men , and films like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the personal figures and the great . &quot;

i know there are other companies in the world also with compassion , but google is the environment that i know because i &apos;m 10 years . so i &apos;m going to use google as a case .
so , it turns out google is a company with compassion because it &apos;s going to find that compassion makes fun .
and you get to work in the morning , and i have three colleagues who decide from the sky to build a hospital in india .
there are three steps .
and i hope compassion is also going to get for them to be more fun .
but one day , the perfect case came . it was a kind of a , which was a computer who was sitting in front of her house .
i met with one of the most of the most , which was the training of the training and the unconscious , which is the normal tendency to be in contrast to the defenders .
people often tell me , &quot; you know , that &apos;s wonderful , but it &apos;s highly powerful .
in the same way , you &apos;re going to experience , if you sit in the new yorker , and read that , this is the most easy and easy feeling .
different parts of the world have a touch for different things .
and the same time , the beautiful work of the computer &apos;s work , which has made these beautiful pieces of water and the most beautiful .
but the objects are cutting up from complete the kind of water of water , and it was really very wide called the water .
even this chair you open and then put them together , so they &apos;re going to get their self-worth . and that beautiful series of objects that are considered me from the design of the hydrothermal .
what has image to do with this ?

it &apos;s the heart of medical care .

the generation y seems to be a lot of the .
100 people are collecting themselves to nonviolent march and a idiot or a condom , and guess who &apos;s going to be captured by the cameras . this one guy .

i said , &quot; if 500 or 2,000 , my life is over . &quot;

this helped us create a very ethical and very strong organization , and a system that they supported .
we have a simple digital digital system in a more of the way , and we &apos;re doing a kind of a little bit of a doctor &apos;s way to do this .
our revenue are very much faster , which has been a healthy profit , and that although we treat a lot of people free .
this is a difficult task .
for example , we can add digital content with physical mass .
wouldn &apos;t that be a way to make mobile phones intuitive ?
it was when they couldn &apos;t see me more than i was invisible .
and also , nobody had heard a whole period of a time or saw this action , and that &apos;s what the creation of new ways of looking at , and knowledge , because now they have this concept in your head in your head .
like bp , the hole is going to attract the hole at least , but not a huge price to demand .
so , not so upset .
and it &apos;s also the story of modern capitalism , because it was the wealth of this country , which was created our system system , a system that doesn &apos;t survive without the more of the growth of the frontier .
the oil is not liquid ; it &apos;s not liquid .

second ballot and julia , and the , and the , and diana , and diana , and the president , and that &apos;s love !
and i &apos;m going to sit in the wheelchair for seven years , i &apos;ve done more in life than outside of him .
we have a lot of generations about generations of the same species , as millions of other species that live with us .
but it &apos;s not a normal movie .
but if i took a base on the screen , it &apos;s a base of the screen with the resolution of the x x distributed , we would need 3,000 screens to take a look at the genome .
what does this mean for medicine ?
and so he sequenced the genome of his children .
it &apos;s because there was somebody in the audience who wants to stop eating .
imagine , in the year , the leading candidate is not only their four years of urban revenue , but they also personal genome .
and so i &apos;m all going to do it , and i &apos;m going to get the genomic revolution to influence them around them .
and we have a flexible , sophisticated , a special , special , special part of the world &apos;s , and the edges of the hip is moving along .
hopefully it will allow us to see this technology more of the survivors of the survivors .
on the branch , which is the sample of the sample , they put a switch of gas and dies .
so , so exciting . he can create the most powerful of the early , so we &apos;re going to be able to capture a lot of new particles .
the most famous charge is the electric charge .
they say , what changes are . also , also . also .

the pattern of dots that i showed you is actually describe symmetries of this kind of thing , which is moving , moving and on the most remote of space-time .
and we also heard about history from the tree of humanity through genetic health .
in the world &apos;s most , many examples of compassion , and the real altruism for love and real altruism .
most importantly , i think it &apos;s to work with small groups of women , to give you the opportunity to be the way of the picture of the world &apos;s .
and you know what i mean . i &apos;m talking about pollution -- .
take the most of the problems that we have the planet we have in the planet , in terms of the environment and social . it &apos;s a message of hope .
and the mighty pregnancies and similar things , which young people hear better from other teenagers than adults .

working with the plastic , about the first eight years , some of my pieces started to break up and break into smaller .
recycling . everybody finished about the book about the idea of recycling ecology with the idea of recycling .

the author of the book is juan , our favorite , our favorite , and it &apos;s going to be brilliant by amazon .

i lost a child , a second , a second , when i was 16 .
i know what it means to suffer , and if a crime happens , a person should be fair , and they &apos;re being inappropriate . &quot;
but what if that wouldn &apos;t be ?
and i thought , after a few of the time , i thought that i was going to be here , which is the bottle bottle .
that &apos;s what it add .

mao tse : she always described as the european civil war , and that &apos;s probably a more accurate description .

but this is not the case .
the behavioral challenges of nations , now we &apos;ve always had .
but now one last thing .

they tend to feed themselves to feed .
for the little example i think here in the hand , we &apos;ve used a system that &apos;s going to react to my skin by putting this little light .
so often amateurs were not experts , no experts , the inventor and the most of the things like mountain bike , computer , computers , planes ...
and then computers were still big forms that only scientists were interested in , and nobody just dreamed of it , to have one of them .
you just have the own eyes to come through .
i mean that he was seen .
we have the driver &apos;s driver &apos;s driver , and we studied .
and i said , i can &apos;t bring them , but i can bring them into zero , in zero gs , in zero gs gs .
we had four of the people who were in the airplane .
and actually , you can show some pictures , because i don &apos;t want to see on the screen .
no life , from the smallest life to us all here , would be without these little micro-machines .
i was in a shower . i went to eat .
i didn &apos;t change myself . my iq wasn &apos;t down .
i was a writer .
so basically nobody would accept family planning when your child won &apos;t survive .
and then we decided why not the religion use , because on the philippines , the catholic church was pretty strong , and the buddhist church are buddhist .
we did our first world bank , and the women who said it was organized , &quot; we just want to borrow women to work .
you can call it the coca-cola approach if you like . it &apos;s exactly the same thing .
and then aids in all schools , started in university .
and then here , with the american flag , &quot; don &apos;t go home . &quot;
these are things that are going to be made of business .

you can see the tips , but you can see .
the challenge for the most of the players is whether he believes the other is fair or that it &apos;s going to be a little bit of commandments that it &apos;s just one or two dollars to be available .
now i &apos;m going to give you a few relatives .
we can try it . maybe we will .
so what have we learned today ?
about 10 calories needs to be needed to make a finite food that we consume in the west .
so how did a city get like this ?
and in the east , the city in the east , they &apos;re going to send them to sale . that &apos;s why it &apos;s called the most important thing .
and in this point , our relationship is completely , both to food as well as the cities .
the word of the word system used thomas moore .
and a lot of the data of the data .
we need to understand that the world is also what we eat .
it &apos;s the source of all morality , this kind of kind of disaster of the world &apos;s act , to put itself on the place of another .
and i see that this is a profound intelligence , not just a sense of a sense of feeling .
in the present economy , we have a representative -- two years &#91; unclear &#93; , a half to a million parts , quite complex , new and exciting technologies from steel , concrete , glass .
the next project is that in question , and look at passive nature or the passive attempt to make it .
basically , you have a chain of elements .
when i was in a literal , wisconsin was , i thought , a public talk of the school school .
often we &apos;re looking for the of the irrigation of the irrigation like flu .
there are unknown everywhere around us , and it &apos;s just going to be discovered .
could we now go off the light , so we can see it ?
so we &apos;re chemical , which is different . our way of chemical is the universality .
but i have to say -- and i &apos;m asking to bear richard -- that i never liked biological , and i think we &apos;re going to have a whole couple of millions of years .
everybody talks about things today , a reduction of the world &apos;s worth to put every price .
he realized that it &apos;s possible to make different laws that allow the economy to have small profits to win the incentives , more customers .

so , much of those have the idea of the special part of the special , that people can support in rules .
how would we write such a treaty ?
you thought in genomics a little bit more than 10 years ago , you &apos;d like to have a little bit of this year between three and five genomes , it &apos;s already hundreds .
if there &apos;s a lot of flowering , you &apos;re very much a lot of green light .
the number of common genes are extended a little bit when we ignored a little parasite , and it was bigger when we focused on certain of the genes , about the most remote .
it &apos;s a genome for a radiation , through the chromosomes in small pieces , in the 12 to 24 hours , in 12 to 24 hours .
let me close with ethical and political studies .
of course , that &apos;s worth , if you like a marshmallow .
we call them &quot; stimulation . &quot; they focus on what will be .

i can &apos;t tell you how that was , the first images of the probe of the spacecraft . this was what we saw .
so here we see a film from the body of the body , which shows these dunes . these dunes are 100 feet tall , have a distance from some kilometers and the more , and they &apos;re going to be a mile and they &apos;re going to get miles .
now , the earth is still the only planet where we know that it &apos;s from life .
they had lost 40 percent of their country , and they were the way they had no free access to the rest of the west bank .
and this is a peaceful march .
so we organized a show .
it took only four days .
and as the rest of the brain is , he &apos;s from neurons .
in the hippocampus of the hippocampus , you actually find cells that are in the hippocampus , which are just responding to the grasp of borders or edges in a certain distance and the edges , if you study the environment .
and this would be shown by fire , and this would be the fire of the fire .
he wasn &apos;t the only man who suffered in america without a single , and he was not the only great speakers of his time .
and why should someone care about it ?
people don &apos;t buy what they do , but why they do it .
the neocortex is responsible for all our rational and analytical thoughts and language .
it &apos;s always the same three things , so let &apos;s look at it .
and if you talk about what you believe , you &apos;ll be able to attract the ones that believe what they believe .
the reason that people bought a iphone in the first six hours , for six hours , was her worldview , and her will , that everybody sees them . they were the first one .

i think last time we care about our health care , it &apos;s not the sick , that were fixed , but in the diseases that were eaten .
the $ common is a real danger of the world today , but that &apos;s in indian ocean .

the circles represent the countries .
some countries have already had statistics .
but we need to have a whole piece of turning the u.s. to find the same health that there are today on the philippines .
it changes .
this looks like a happy story .
what you &apos;re doing here -- which is the altitude you &apos;re living -- your daily work is doing .
it &apos;s about having food .
it &apos;s this stupid concept of the developing world that we , argentina and mozambique 50 years ago , and say that mozambique has been more likely to evolve .
governance . a working government -- that led california from the most of the time of the hebrew .
and i showed the approach , how the seemingly impossible possible .
and the enemy pretty weak .
we &apos;re -- despite skepticism -- with viagra in afghanistan .
&quot; it &apos;s not a ideal world . &quot; &quot; and your government doesn &apos;t get us closer . &quot;
how would a rules look like this ?
what we need to do is a more of the time that we need a lot of a time .
do you want a better system ?
and the doctor says he just didn &apos;t move it as well .
&quot; who &apos;s going to attack us , risk of the world . &quot;
the leviathan force is just going to be left from his pen .
it &apos;s going to be a little bit of the time .
air force , strategic groups of groups .
thomas barnett : a new way to peace
i don &apos;t want to get it too much .
here you see the most early in the early world , which brought a lot of sulfur into the stratosphere with a kind of nuclear cloud .
this report ended up at president , when i was two years old . 1965 .
but let &apos;s say , they have sunlight , which is true in particles and it &apos;s a legal footprint .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to happen . it &apos;s not very likely .
we continue to go on from this scenario and continue to remove the present climate .
not just about how we do better , what are the risks and side effects ?
here you see a fish with a little bit of a fish , and you see your eyes .
really incredible . here are two males .
and so i came up with her friendly invitation just two days ago from the himalayas .
but if you look at the literature in east and west , you will find incredibly different definitions of happiness .
well-being is a deeper sense for serenity and fulfillment , a state that actually all the states are all the u.s. and they &apos;re concerned and all the joy of us .
we know that we can be able to be in something that you can be called &quot; little paradise , &quot; and inside , but inside , it can be completely unhappy .
the mirror allows that , but the mirror is not being fed by that , it &apos;s not changing by these images .
if you &apos;re doing that again , your tendency to get the anger back to each time , because they &apos;re turning it down , lower .
